8,i940wjk,t3_usia07,"Netflix diluted their own brand so badly. 

When they first started producing original content the pitch was ""Check *this* shit, we're making Hollywood-tier movies"" and pretty much you felt compelled to want to check them out on the basis that you trusted they were throwing considerable production effort behind them. 

Then they shifted to the ""greenlight everything, cancel after 2 seasons"" model which again, at first was kind of interesting because it did get a lot of creative and novel stuff out that would have otherwise never been produced. 

But eventually they've wound up in a place where the little red N is just as likely to mean 'high quality original production' as it is 'literally the dumbest shit you've ever seen in your life' and that's just a bad place to be, especially against the reality that over time users more or less out-watch the pace at which good new content can be made.

At the same time, they let licenses expire on a lot of non-Netflix content while competitors stepped up with compelling services. End result, Netflix is flooded with red N content that the user basically has no idea if it's worth their time. 

A simple 'fix' would be rebranding and making imprints instead of placing everything under the N banner, but it's probably too little and too late for that.",iuytrefdgh436yujhe2,1652902236.0,227

The screen can be traveling in the backseat of my car with my daughter, or it could be my laptop screen with me on vacation. You don't get to say which screen I use; only how many screens I can use at the same time. Maybe I like watching four shows all at once, each on a separate VM with separate VPNs (New York, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles) but all on my local screen (because I'm fancy like that).

That's the deal, that's what we agreed upon.

If you want to offer new subscription models with adjustments to the number of screens, then go for it. For the most part we partake in capitalism, and if you offer a competitive service that people agree is valuable, then people will switch. It is not my job to tell you how to make your money, but it will be my delight to tell you to piss up a flag pole if you try and offer a service I don't want; or moreover, a service I feel swindled or otherwise cheated into.

Don't cancel your originals out of nowhere and leave massive cliffhangers that will never be resolved.  Give producers enough notice or pony up the cash for enough episodes to wrap things up with a satisfying ending.

Clean up your UI.  There are too many transitions, they're too slow, and there are too many clicks.

I had assumed that with Netflix being well established and their algorithms that they’d have nailed what to suggest to users now, but it seems instead to have become less accurate as time has gone on. 

The stories about Netflix losing subscribers has turned a blip in to a disaster for Netflix because it had become one of those unconscious aspects to monthly budgeting. I paid for it every month but when I saw that many others had cancelled it I thought about it properly for the first time in ages and realised I am nowhere near getting value for the monthly fee. I kept it as a convenience because ‘sometimes’ there was a show I wanted to watch, the the truth is that had become rarer and rarer. So now I have also cancelled my subscription. I hope they commit to better longer running shows (I think not making a 3rd season of Mindhunter was ridiculously short sighted. They assumed they could produce hits like a factory, but must now realise they cannot and shouldn’t have thrown away that opportunity). 

Netflix will no doubt introduce adverts, which will provoke fury but no long term damage. The long term damage is that even when subscriber numbers went up and up they struggled to make a profit and only recently did so. That has been achieved by reducing spending on marketing and new shows. Now they are finding their subscribers are losing interest due to those cut backs so a slide towards reduced profits (or even losses) beckons. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The business seems to be very highly valued but eventually investors will want to see how that will translate in to sustained profits and I don’t think Netflix have an answer (and nor do I).",TheEconomistFable,1650883765.0,125

467,i7ewl1b,t3_uisagt,"I really wonder how many people are in the same boat as me:  

We are continuously signed up, but only watch it every couple months (Witcher a few months ago, Ozark right now, probably Stranger things in a few months). My mom's house has our account on her TV because my kids visit often enough that they use it there, and I think there's a possibility it's at my wife's parents house as well.

Literally the only reason we don't cancel is because it's ingrained in our system already and we don't want to take it away from the possible use at the parents house. If they start charging extra for it, or stop us from doing it? It's just canceled, that's all. We'll put Disney+ or Hulu or Sling up when they visit again. It seriously feels like a gym membership for one you barely attend threatening more fees at this point.

(edit:  as one Redditor pointed out, I forgot to mention *Is It Cake?* as a show that was worth the sub)

(edit2:  a few clarifications for things that have come up a few times: 

 I didn't mean *literally* like a gym membership, but as in a fee you keep paying even though you're not really using it, so there is no need to explain how I can't physically sneak people into a gym.

I absolutely agree it would be smarter to just quit everything and only subscribe to one service a month, cancel it, swap, etc. But there's no way most of us are doing that on multiple devices each month.

All streaming services are having just a little trouble understanding this. The reason that Rogan is so successful and that people initially moved away from cable, to YouTube and streaming had nothing to do with content, really. It had to do with ads.

Think back. Remember how fed up everyone was with traditional ads? 5 minutes of a movie on cable followed by 20 minutes of commercials?

That's it. And now they are polluting everything with ads once again. Especially youtube. People would rather watch a 5 minute video of some guy tickling his cat without ads, then a blockbuster movie on cable with 2 hrs of ads. Entertainment isn't that precious or complicated.

Then the meat provider also pulls out, leaving the burritos made of just cabbage and sauce.

In the UK at least, Netflix feels like the default streaming service still. Disney+ is pretty popular too but doesn't have the diversity of Netflix and we don't have HBO etc over here. I imagine a lot of other markets are the same.

779,i5u8s8r,t3_u9wsbx,"For those too lazy to read the article, they plan to charge $3 per person not located in your household. A household now refers specially to primary account profile and has nothing to do with relation to primary account holder. For example, if your kid goes to college, they will be counted as an ""extra member"", and you'll have to pay extra. To quote the article ""Each sub-account will have its own profile and personalized recommendations — but they also have their own Netflix login and password..."" They plan to overhaul the profile section and will associate the profile with certain IP's and device ID's so you can travel and use multiple devices with the same profile. A sub-account is basically one of the sub-profiles but, based on Netflix's tracking, is considered to be another household due to the location difference.
It's not set in stone yet, so hopefully they realize this will tank them harder than ads ever could. They probably won't make they change until 2023 anyways. Their own research has shown there are 100 million households of the 220 million subscribers that share passwords. I don't think 100 million people are going to be pleased with a $3+ price increase.

Video streaming services have never understood the correct model, and have failed to adapt the same way the music industry has.

I subscribe to YouTube Music, and they have a comprehensive collection of 99.9% of the music I would ever want to listen to.  I don't have to subscribe to multiple services.  I don't have to worry that certain albums are going to suddenly disappear without warning, never to be available again.  And I don't have to worry that YouTube Music will only stream music produced by Google.

Compare that with all the video streaming services.  They have a small fraction of the available content.  Content appears and disappears without warning, and now each service's content is dominated by their own shows/movies (with wildly varying quality).

I know people with enormous pirated music collections, who just stopped pirating music once modern streaming services appeared.  A good product at a reasonable price.

If there was a single video streaming service, that had a comprehensive, permanent collection, available at a reasonable price, it would immediately crush the opposition.  But because that doesn't exist, people will quit the legit services in favour of piracy.",shampy311,1650689979.0,68

When the farmer and the baker conspire, they have the power to starve the nation and extort the government. This is what anti-trust laws are supposed to prevent. This is what net-neutrality is about. This is how you get feudal empires.

Welcome to **technological neo-feudalism**, folks. An economic system wherein all the technological means of production and distribution are owned by the same few hands, private ownership is replaced by rent (aka 'subscription'), and creative potential is crushed under the weight of expensive equipment and exclusive licenses that only our neo-feudal overlords can afford.

And while everyone is busy arguing over prices, competition, and ads, .. our overlords quietly keep buying up every studio and every franchise out there until there is no one else left but them. Because every tech-giant and megacorporation out there knows one thing: **""if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.""** Economic hegemony isn't about having the best product or even the highest profit .. but about possessing such an overwhelming amount of resources that no one stands a chance against you.

This is neither a failure of technology nor a failure of economics but a **failure of laws**. Netflix is dead in the long term. It has nowhere near the means to buy up the studios and the equipment it needs to compete with behemoths like Disney and Warner, nor the leverage to pay off governments to update anti-trust laws or even just enforce existing ones.

Thing is it seemed easier back then to stay up with what shows to pirate because keeping up with what was on TV was relatively easy with a pretty high rate of knowing if I would like it or not based off the premise and word of mouth. The shows during prime time were easy enough to check, and it wasn't like I had to waste my time sorting out the trash that airs at 1 pm on a weekday or bother with whatever Lifetime was airing, but now it is all lumped together with nothing to easily distinguish the shlock from the good stuff unless it gets big.  

Now with the way streaming services having shows coming out any time of the year being so segmented(can't browse netflix without subscribing to netflix) and the buzz dying out so quickly in the binge era it seems much harder for me to find the stuff I actually want to watch in order to pirate.",thealthor,1653858294.0,1

I am a Democrat because I align more with them then Republicans but I rarely if ever have agreed with the entire Democratic platform at any time.  All of the creeps off with their heads.  I know you weren't cool with the link I posted but I promise it is a site about Atheism and the essay dealt with crimes committed by politicians.  So I agree both have creeps, I don't think on this point they are equal.  We are talking 800 Republicans convicted in a state or federal court, sentenced to many years of prison and in the media and on social media, the narrative is that its Democrats that are the pedos. It seems to me like politicians should hold each other accountable and not defend the actions, but decry and shame them.  Political power shouldn't supercede upholding the legitimacy of our government.

This is the beginning of the end.  From here, they crackdown on account sharing.  Because Reed has an inflated opinion, surely all of those cut-off people will want their own subscriptions.  Right?  Bingo, instant growth.  Right?

What's really about to happen is a death spiral.  All of the competitive services have pulled back their current libraries as well, making Netflix bereft of content from this decade.  Not a problem, Netflix still creates a ton of content.  Except, the ""fail fast"" methodology of developing content has alienated a majority of their users.  

So growth is flat and people are starting to leave.  Wall St hates that.  Where to get new subs?  Well you can't attract people with value b/c you're already 2x the cost of your competition, so you have to manufacture new subs by cutting off a bunch of ""freeloaders"", forcing them to sign up if they want to watch.

They were wrong

 If they go forward with cracking down on shared accounts then they are not going to double their subscriber count they are going to lose the people who are being told they can no longer share their account.

Netflix is always competing against piracy.  Piracy is free. Netflix is kind of convenient compared to piracy, but when you're competing with free because you're convenient you have to be cheap.

Their bread & butter WAS that they had all the streaming content in one accessible place for a more attractive price than cable.

The actual content creators saw that it was actually massively successful so they took their content back & made their own services.

Sucks to be Netflix, but they didn't give up there...

They pivoted to try and make their own content and in some cases it worked!

Meanwhile seasoned content providers like HBO who are content creators first & foremost knew how to make, run & conclude compeling shows (Except that one...)  are now offering their far superior content on their more attractively priced services than Netflix.  

Netflix is now competeing with that.  They start shows then kill them when they get too expensive or whatever. They also seem to buy shows other people didn't want & slap a ""Netflix original"" sticker on it.

It's one thing to not have the newest and hottest movies on release, but they should have them eventually. Yet they don't.

Worse, they've completely lost their edge with older titles. If you think of an older classic, *Predator* with the Governator, for example, it's a 99% certainty Netflix doesn't have it. You should be able to go ""aw man, I haven't seen *Ghostbusters* in forever"" and be watching it on Netflix five seconds later, but nope. 

So no matter what movie you want to watch, Netflix doesn't have that, and it never will. It always offers some insult, instead, like the shitty sequel to the original with none of the original players involved. 

Their originals can be quite good, which could keep viewers. Alas, they've also gotten a reputation for killing any show you care about after two seasons, max. We'll still be waiting for season two of *Mindhunter* when we're all in the grave. 

So people don't even want to invest themselves in the television stuff, lest they build an interest and find themselves abandoned. 

I don't know WHAT all this jank Great Value anime has been. Again, same, you hear good things about an anime, Netflix no have, every time. But here's this stupid looking thing, instead, complete with booty CGI. Here's one season of a good anime so you can listen to everyone else talk about how much they enjoy season two. I could never tell if I'd fucked my algorithm and Netflix had just decided I was an otaku with low standards, or if that crap was all they had. Don't get me started on algo jail, I'm getting real fed up with that. 

So they didn't have movies on lock, they don't have shows on lock, they don't have anime on lock, and 90% of their programming is weird random crap. Sometimes it turns out to be good, but it felt more like Netflix went from being THE place to be for general entertainment to the modern equivalent of an also-ran old-school cable channel where they dumped all the low budget shit, and never, ever the fun stuff, either. Walmart dollar-bin shit.  

I know WHY it's happening. They went from being the only game in town to heavy competition and they were relying on their competition for all the good stuff. Now nobody else wants to let them have anything. Disney owns damn near everything and guess who's got their own streaming now?

Netflix has been coasting hard on people just letting them drain the paycheck out of sheer inertia. If there are any local video stores still alive, THEY are now more competitive than Netflix is, now. At least you can walk in and pick up old blockbusters. Shoulda kept that disk program, fools.

1402,i5imy8l,t3_u80ie4,"Before, when there were less streaming services, Netflix had more on offer because they were pretty much the only game in town. Literally everything was on there, and in the beginning of streaming, if it wasn't available to stream, they would send you the DVD (Also, does anyone else remember when Hulu was free, and they streamed the network tv shows next-day, which was paid for by commercials and ads? And then they went to a payment plan with no ads, and then swapped it to having ads, and now you have to pay even more for a service with no ads? Do you see how this is just getting worse for the consumer as we go?). Over time, that content has been sold to other services and is no longer available on Netflix, and what really sucks is the whole ""rotating catalog"" where stuff disappears at the end of the month - especially if you are in the middle of a season or tv show run and it just goes away before you've finished it.  
  
  
  
What would have been the right thing to do for Netflix, would have been to lower the price when the catalog shrank, therefore giving wider access to other people. This would have increased their overall subscriber count, even with a smaller catalog. Instead what they did was take the extra money they were getting from buying less shows to produce their own shows, some of which were really great, only to be canceled in the middle of their runs, upsetting the fans and subscribers even more. So now we don't trust Netflix to follow through with their produced shows, can expect an ever shrinking catalog of content as streaming diversifies into a situation that leaves us paying just as much or more than we were with cable for an even worse experience (having to manage a bunch of different subscriptions, logins, swapping apps, the apps themselves sucking, etc.), all for the pleasure of paying \*even more\* as they bump the price? It's not like we are all getting cost of living wage increases as inflation hits us, so on what basis are they raising their prices. Are they going to guarantee not to just dump their quality shows on cliffhangers? Are they going to ensure the content you're in the middle of isn't pulled from the service while you are watching it?

Service fragmentation is making people choose between different services, whilst Netflix is the incumbent, its certainly not the only player in the market.

Pandemic reduced show output, which has harmed Netflix's catalogue arguably more as its had 'legacy' content pulled by other rights owners into their own platforms. Cancellation of shows probably doesn't help this either.

1710,i97dx3m,t3_uswwui,"Serious question... would it be a better business move for Netflix to just switch back to being a hub for older tv and movies? I'm not implying they should turn into some version of Turner Classic Movies, but rather just focus on their original concept of having a massive catalog of shows that already exist instead of getting into the production business. I honestly can't decide if that would make it worth keeping. I can get nearly everything I watch on it from other services anymore.

When I first subscribed to Netflix, I used it to watch all my favorite old shows *on top* of my cable bill. When I cut out cable, a large consideration was that I'd still have all the older shows/movies to watch, and I'd just be a season or two behind everyone else when the newest show/season was added. Ever since they shifted funding to producing 8-episode show after 8-episode show that *might* be good (but will almost certainly be cancelled), they don't have the money to maintain their catalog of shows that made Netflix worth it to begin with.

This is just an idea I've been mulling over. I feel like if some new company popped into existence today and offered exactly what Netflix did when they first started for $10 or less per month, I'd drop Netflix like a bad habit and switch over.",craigles,1652969941.0,3

First, the quality of their original content was just too low in general. The second (even more frustrating) issue is there tendency to cancel the occasional good show they did manage to make on CLIFFHANGER ENDINGS!!!!!!!!!

This left me in a situation where I didn't want to watch the bad content (for obvious reasons) AND I didn't want to watch the good content because I'd been conditioned to expect it to end badly and not be worth it.

The main reason though is price its to expensive and it keeps going up, the worlds not in a good place at the moment not everyone can afford it anymore as such they stop paying for it.

Then there is content, a lot of old series have been taken off Netflix by there various owners and used in there own streaming services as such with less content there is less reason to keep netflix

But what about netflix origonal content? Well people are starting to get tired of getting invested in a series that ends after one or two seasons more so if there are cliff hangers at the end.  And for the other series you actually want to follow well you can quit then just come back for a month binge watch the new series then quit again no need to stay subcribed in the mean time.

A lot of people pay to let other people use there accounts like friends or family,  with password sharing now going to cost more it is less of an incentive to keep paying for netflix.  People are more inclined to accept a price increase if there getting more for the new cost but making people pay for something they already for for free stings and can backfire.

Lastly is there potential cheaper paid for service but with adverts. This has never gone down well.  If it was a free service but with adverts people would accept that but no one wants to pay for an advert supported service.",DarkJayson,1650768638.0,21

1810,i62f21l,t3_uakdzb,"Something I've talked about for years with cases like this is ""goodwill"", the most valuable resource public-facing companies have and the most difficult for distant executives to track.

A common trajectory companies follow as they transition from passion projects into high-capital engines is to start burning their goodwill reserves. The original leaders, those who understand the product and market and often care deeply for their customer experience, spend years building up goodwill with those customers. Then, as corporate interests gain sway, a few decisions get made that make the customers a little less happy.

And the numbers go up! The customers pretty much all stick around, because of inertia and loyalty. Costs go down, revenue goes up, the company is more successful and nothing bad happens. Because *goodwill doesn't show up in the numbers.* Not the ones the corporate types are paying attention to. But the company just spent some of their most precious resource, and in most cases they spent it cheaply.

So they do it again. After all, they did their research. Those old-timers told them there would be consequences if they squeezed the customers, but the trial run went so well. Next time it's a little bigger. They push just a little harder. Not too much. Maybe the old-timers are right. Take baby steps, and watch the numbers to be safe. But the numbers are all still going up. See, we're business geniuses! The early owners just didn't have the vision to navigate these complicated decisions. And a little more goodwill burns away.

Eventually, you hit a breaking point as big chunks of customers start to peel off. They stop buying the new sets. They decide not to renew their subscription. They switch to a competing brand. The suits start to worry, but no big deal. That *last* decision was a little too far. It caused a bit of a dip in the numbers. Now we know the point where people start getting upset. Pull back a little, back into the safe zone, and things will get better.

But they don't. They get worse. Because even making slightly more customer-friendly decisions, they're still running at a goodwill deficit. So they spend more of the goodwill they don't have, and the company starts to bleed customers for real.

But that doesn't make any sense! They were *fine* with this amount of pressure. They were fine with it for months! Maybe years! This must be something else. Pull back a little farther, just to be safe, but start looking for the real problem. But even now, the company is still trying to spend goodwill that's long since drained away, and it's hemorrhaging customers now.

This is a big way that companies die. It seems sudden and random and unforseeable to the people responsible, because they started making the wrong decisions a long time ago and didn't realize it. Because goodwill doesn't show up on the balance sheet, but it's the most expensive asset to spend.",UCS_White_Willow,1650845305.0,7

1900,i5zx6su,t3_uakdzb,"Hot take... Maybe...

Streaming services are forced to provide reasonable services (price, content, access, etc) not only because competition (which is subject to abuse) but also because of piracy. 

Piracy, for better or worse, ultimately forces steaming services to play fair when it comes to pricing and content. Now not everyone is going to pirate, but a lot will, and what's telling is how well companies like Pandora, Spotify Amazon music, etc. have done at providing the music you want, when you want it, at a price you're willing to pay versus just pirating it.  

I think streaming services are close to figuring this out, but Netflix (as others have said) is just not nearly user friendly enough, nor content conscious enough to be as appealing anymore.  

When you eliminate user access to meaningful ways of rating and sorting the material, when you market, produce, and provide content only to cancel it a season or two later, you're doing it wrong.

I've been relatively happy with Netflix, but commercials will absolutely kill it for me, and after the last price hike, having to pay more to avoid it is a slap in the face.",rainemaker,1650806532.0,2

And I don't have to worry that YouTube Music will only stream music produced by Google.

Compare that with all the video streaming services.  They have a small fraction of the available content.  Content appears and disappears without warning, and now each service's content is dominated by their own shows/movies (with wildly varying quality).

I know people with enormous pirated music collections, who just stopped pirating music once modern streaming services appeared.  A good product at a reasonable price.

I could pay for Netflix for one month every 6 months, watch everything new without breaking a sweat, then cancel it again for 6 months. 

Instead of looking at their product as garbage and trying to improve it, they’re doubling down now.

They’re going to crack down on multiple screens? It will take years to figure that out.  I pay for 4 screens.  What if I’m watching on my IPad in a hotel or remotely?  What about at a friends house or the office?  They can lock in 4 devices but what’s to stop me from locking in my Firetv, my neighbor’s Firetv, my grandma’s Firetv, and my phone?

I admit I don’t share my account so this doesn’t affect me.  I do have 3 kids with iPads, 5 TV’s, and 2 phones with Netflix on it.  So I guess I need to pay for 3 accounts? No thanks.  1337x.to and PLEX will solve that problem.

Commercials (for me) will be the final straw.  This is too expensive for 3-4 shows a year and 2-3 “big budget” movies…now with commercials.

Why is it so weird?

Because when you look at the numbers, Netflix is doing the best they ever have.

The 200,000 subscriber drop is a garbage argument.  Why?  Because it's literally 0.1% of their subscribers.  Because their subscriber growth had been nearly linear since 2013 AND Q1 2022 is NOT below the trend line.  They had a spike in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 is just a correction of that, aka a bunch of people signed up late Q4 instead of early Q1.  And because there have been numerous quarters with near zero growth in the past.  Q1 2022 is NOT an outlier, like at all.

People whine about the price increases.  Well, Netflix has had a lot of price increases.  This is quite 3 normal.  Oh but subscribers will cancel, right?  Know what hadn't happened after every past price increase?  People leaving.  Historically, subscribers are almost completely insensitive to price changes.  So assuming the recent price increase is going to do something wildly different is silly.  The past data shows they don't care and have never cared.

The huge amount of media around this stuff is just whacky.  No data backs the media's stance.  I don't even know why the stock was affected at all.  Netflix is literally pulling in the highest revenue it ever has, but its price is back to where it was pulling in half as much.  That's crazy.  The stock is the cheapest it's been in nearly half a decade for literally no reason.  I like sales, but this is a damn give away.

I really don't get it, but I'll happily buy the cheap stock.  I feel that's the point, like the actual plan of all of this, because this media blitz is unnatural.",mvw2,1650689004.0,3

They give the stuff away that people really want, or run a show for a couple of seasons then cancel it, making people less likely to invest the time when it's ""live"" or, even worse, after the show's run is over so now there are only two seasons of a show that was clearly unfinished when they shut it down. Then they trying to skate by with these half-arsed other shows ...

Netflix is about to be in for the shock of their lives. They lost subscribers... so now they want to raise prices? Implement advertising? And they're screaming about account sharing to keep their stockholders from losing faith, saying they're going to ""crack down"" on that? All of which will do nothing more than a) remind people that they HAVE a Netflix account, and cause them to wonder exactly why that is, since they don't watch it. Boom: unsubscribe. Or b) prevent access to a ""sharee"" and replace it with nothing, since under no circumstance was the person who was using someone else's account, now going to pay for it. 

Meanwhile, Amazon Prime seems to do just about everything right. It's not difficult to imagine all of this turning out very poorly for Netflix. If they're so desperate as to start saying, ""Sometimes you've just got to make a change. Do it for change's sake. Do something, even if it's wrong.""

There are several things that I really dislike about Netflix though that have me thinking about cancelling it.
First being the overall selection of movies and series, it's been stagnated for quite a while and they don't seem too bothered going for more niche choices from time to time, it makes the selection pretty boring in general.
And I've seen a lot of you guys calling out them cancelling their own shows without resolutions, and that has been my biggest peeve so far. 3 series have been cancelled that I really liked, and from what I've seen in supposed viewer numbers (no hard facts to find on it, just snooper stats as far as I know) and ratings, they've been pretty popular. But the numbers aren't good enough  for Netflix...
Some people won't watch a series until they can binge several seasons, and the marketing of them has been nothing short of horrendous, barely a word about them.
And for the last big reason people are leaving, there is no reason to just sit on a sub and not use it, and it's a saturated market that markets against eachother with blockbusters and notorious IPs (star wars, friends, Marvel and DC stuff and so on) 
And if we want to see all that we want, we're probably gonna jump around subscriptions until we've seen what we want, and just not rest on a sub that's getting used once or twice a month out of boredom rather than interest..

***tl;dr Lean-in on your real selling point, which is convenience and access to media while undercutting your competitors' advantages by bribing congress to strengthen the public domain. You're already burning billions on stupid projects and it's shockingly cheap to bribe congress, and your competitors are stingy assholes. Become the hero of the people with a very public copyright fight and profit.***

1. Cancel all your shows that have low view rates. If there is a contract that you can't break, finish the contract and let the creators know they are done so they can wrap up the shows well.
2. Greenlight additional seasons for already popular shows. Keep it to 10-20.
3. Implement a policy that for all shows going forward, the total length of the show must be predetermined, i.e. one season or three, with the option to extend for another predetermined time in the second to last season. Stop shooting your shows in the foot.
4. Release your shows one episode at a time, once per week.
5. Advertise your flagship shows
6. Most importantly, start spending billions on lobbying and bribes and public sentiment campaigns to get congress to implement the following copyright reforms

* Legal fee shifting for winners in copyright and patent cases (helps small creators fight corporations, i.e. you). Play nice and it won't hurt you.
* Return to opt-in copyright only, abolish automatic copyright protection. This opens up abandoned works to your catalog.
* Require copyrighted works to be registered with the Library of Congress along with contact info for the owner. Now you can know what is copyrighted, when, and who controls it -- a major problem for the vast majority of works that are abandoned.
* Return to 14 year copyright terms retroactively applied, but with an option to extend an additional 14 years with an escalating fee schedule, i.e. initial filing is free, the 7 year renewal is $100k, the 14 year renewal is $1m, the 21 year renewal is $10m. This opens a ton of content for you AND helps society. And you may be thinking ""well, our competitors will have that content too."" Yes, but your app UI is leagues better than theirs, more on that in the next point. Also, this opens your studios to making Star Wars spin-offs, Transformers cartoons, and a crap ton of other stuff all while becoming the hero of the people for making pop culture accessible, as it was always intended to be.
* Ban exclusive copyright licenses and ban content creation companies from also being distributors or having exclusive arrangements with distributors and limits the licensing costs for content to all be within 10% of each other. Wait, doesn't this hurt your business model? No, it doesn't, because your UI is better, it helps reduce your corporate bloat, and it opens all shows for you to host. You keep market share because now Disney+, Peacock, etc. cannot stream anymore and your only real competitors are Hulu, Youtube, Amazon, and Hulu (lol), and you're already dominating that market. This makes you able to focus on being a streaming service while becoming the hero of the people and makes sure you have access to all the content.
* Target Disney in particular for your public awareness campaign, and dig up their corrupt copyright lobbying past. Focus heavily on what becomes public domain with the above terms, and public pressure will be on your side easily.
* Strengthen fair use laws to include any works funded with public money. This doesn't help you, but publicly-funded research should be free and not behind publisher paywalls. Yes, this is a sword you should fall on. It makes you a public hero.

Now, dear Netflix, you are reading this and your c-suite is collectively shitting their pants with fear. After all, how do you become dominant and successful without having totalitarian control over everything? Well, 1) a robust public domain and fair use helps everyone, including you, 2) public perception as the hero of the people will drive subscriber numbers who are fed up with all these other companies, 3) your UI and catalog was your selling point all along and your UI is still is vastly superior to everyone else. You are selling access and convenience, not content. Making the content cheaper for you and you profit, even if it also makes the content cheaper for others. If you were able to have the entire catalog of Disney, ESPN, HBO, NBC, etc. but so are they, why would anyone care to use a branded platform when they can have one with better UI? Lean in to copyright reform, Netflix. It's counterintuitive to narcissists in the c-suite who mistakenly think the only way to survive is to eat or be eaten, but collaboration and community is a proven strategy that is vastly more powerful than lone wolves trying to make it by in the wild.

And you're already burning billions on stupid stuff already. Senators and representatives are shockingly cheap to bribe. You could easily bribe the whole of congress with a single billion, and with how cheap Disney, etc. are, it wouldn't take that much more to collectively beat them at their own copyright game. Just commit to a billion in bribes and campaign donations per year, or roughly $1.8 million per congressperson per year, and you'll outspend even the most egregious lobbyists by a factor of 10 to 100 all while making your own profits back easily with subscriber numbers who will flee the other services with terrible UI's and ads.",frogontrombone,1652877270.0,1

Imagine employing 5 actual Devs that get some work done. Just picture it in your head how awesome it would be to have an easy ""not interested"" button and the show or movie won't ever show up again. Imagine not seeing shows that you've already finished pop up just because it's all of a sudden ""popular"" again for whatever reason. Imagine seeing it in the list pop up if there are actual new episodes for you to watch and not just having a shitty ""new episodes"" thumbnail smacked on the title even if you already watched the whole new season.

I'd argue that Netflix's initial customer complaint came from raising prices, then came the content quality and password restriction issues. Also, during its first year and, in particular at-launch Disney + kinda sucked. Some of the Avenger & Spider Man movies were/are under contract and not yet available. I think the next big releases were Jungle Book and Beauty & Beast, which weren't available for like a year after their theater release. Their next questionable move was the Mulan release which they charged $30-$40 to view, not own. I will say that their catalog has continued to improve and will eventually be quite massive and has a lot of potential. However, we do not know what the pricing ladder looks like as that catalog continues to grow.

The hugely expensive exclusives with budgets comparable to theatrical releases will slowly decrease, the budgets will shrink, and the service will end up in a gray area between ""*a little better than network television*"" and ""*almost as good as major theatrical films.*""",scots,1642735732.0,359

Notwithstanding Netflix's development, it hasn't re-sped up to pre-Covid levels. It's a little different, yet financial backers have been worried about the way that Netflix will keep on developing.

His company had just set a new sales record for not only the quarter but for the whole year. The problem was it didn’t hit the forecast.

They had just set a new sales record but because it wasn’t as large as the forecast the stock to a huge hit. The CEO bitched that it was probably hedge funds doing a massive dump.

The company lost millions in value.

The CEO then said if he had known he would have laid off 5,000 more people just to push the profits over the forecast. (Why do you think they have contract employees.)

It was so much better when I first got it a few years ago, but the quality of the content they have available feels like it's dropped, and the amount of content feels like it's dropped to.

So in my experience on Australian Netflix, it's declining in both quality and quantity. And frankly when I saw they're adding games to netflix now, that just comes across as a massive red flag to me. 

Clearly they either know they don't have enough content to compete, or they know they're about to not have enough due to contracts ending; so they're trying to give customers a reason to stay.

Their Rev was up 10% YOY, they beat EPS estimates by like 20%. Their Q1 sub loss included 700k from a cessation of service in Russia; without that they’d have been a 500k sub gain. Sure, they are absolutely forecasting future sub loss in q2. But their forecasted Q2 loss amounts to less than 1% of users. And for that the stock drops 25%? That’s insanity. 

This isn’t a defense of rising prices or anything - though I think they are completely failing at the original content game lately and the price hike doesn’t exist in a vacuum for subscribers - but to talk about this like it says something about Netflix while also just ignoring that the market will crush you for anything even close to a steady state economy and that’s a fundamental problem with the market in general is just ignorant.",JinDenver,1650427669.0,2

Maybe people forget that Netflix has already done this before.  All they've really done in the past is allow limited simultaneous access up to a number.  At one point, that was a sum of 1.  Only later did Netflix allow multiple simultaneous viewing because, surprise, people watch Netflix is more than one location on a house, on mobile, at work, etc.

Now Netflix can't really do much about this besides keep the same kind of plan open because people DO view in different rooms, mobile, and at work, simultaneously.

All they can really do is strictly enforce specific, approved viewers, and they may require only 3 distinct locations/IPs at one time that might require e-mail verification.  A lot of other websites already do this, so it's not uncommon.  But it will enforce that the owner of the service validate every location it's ever used.  And if they have 6 different people using a service that only allows 3 users, it's going to be a pain to manage all the IP changes all the time because some random friend wants to use it right now.",mvw2,1650416577.0,1

1USD = R$ 4.67
 
Prices here:
Netflix SD: R$ 26
Netflix HD: R$ 40
Netflix 4k : R$ 56

Compare that with:
Apple TV+: R$ 10              
Amazon Prime: R$ 10          
Paramount+: R$ 20             
Discovery+: R$ 20                 
Globoplay (strong local competitor): R$ 25     
HBO Max mobile plan: R$ 20                  
HBO Max multiscreen 4k: R$ 28            
Disney+: R$ 28             
Star+: R$ 33             


- Most of them have a year discount or so, like on Amazon Prime you can reduce to R$7,49 tho yearly plan.

- You can get Disney+ with Star+ bundle, for R$ 46. Or by R$ 10 monthly on first year on Mercado Livre (largest e-commerce retailer). Star+ in Brazil includes ESPN live sports.

- You can also get HBO Max at 50% discount thought Mercado Livre or if you subscribed on first month of Max launch (so I pay R$ 14 on 4k multiscreen). HBO Max in Brazil (and Mexico) has live sports as well. DirecTV GO users had 5 years of HBO/HBO Max. 

- You can get Paramount+ for free on several ISPs, including the largest one. You can also get a 50% discount though Mercado Livre.

- You can get a 50% discount if you buy two years of Globoplay.


Notice how you can get discount (and good ones) on all other streaming services, minus.... Netflix? Not even a yearly plan they have. And they even increased the price to get more ridiculous

I won’t close down my Netflix account because they have shows that I like but I don’t watch any of the ones that are from other countries because of the language barrier.

I think they should have a French Netflix, Indian Netflix, and British Netflix as well as any other countries or Netflix is super popular.

The show the office was originally done in England and then they made a United States version of it and that’s what I think they should do with the other shows made in other countries instead of trying to subtitle them just make them here in America and have two versions of the same show.

> Netflix won&#039;t carry the 20 Russian free-to-air propaganda channels that they could be required to host under Russian law.

> In December 2021, Netflix was added by the Russian regulator, Roskomnadzor, to its register for audiovisual services because the SVOD reached over 100,000 subscribers.

> Netflix is theoretically required as part of a law - known locally as the Vitrina TV law - to distribute 20 &quot;Must-carry&quot; free-to-air Russian news, sports and entertainment TV channels.

At some point this meant that Netflix stopped being about being a platform, the one subscription you needed to have most of the content, to existing significantly on the back of their originals.

I can't say I'm too enthusiastic about this change. Yes, there's competition of a sort, but it's not so much in the sense of, say, Spotify vs Apple Music, where you can get most content on either platform, but instead a series of walled gardens you have to pay for individually for the content, many of which are technically inferior to Netflix/not available on as many platforms etc. So it's about whether you want Disney content or Netflix content or HBO content?

They will keep increasing the price in slow increments over years; this only works if its done super slowly (a 1$ every few years). Before you know it, you are paying 120$ a month for Netflix, and nobody will freak out over it because of how slowly it increased.

The more bigger netflix becomes, and the more people they ""hire"" to work for them.............. the more faster this ""slow increment"" will take place. Next thing you know, the netflix work environment will be exactly like how Hollywood is; a cesspool of ""sucking up to people"" and ""bending over"" just to get ahead (along with allot of ""stabbing people in the back"" behavior).

Most shows shoehorn a scene in the last few minutes of the season after what would have been a satisfying conclusion.

Netflix should insist cliffhangers are kept separate from the season finale. They can then release the 5 minute cliffhanger if another season is announced. This will have the added benefit of allowing them to put a show that is between seasons on the front page again and refresh interest. Netflix wants people excited for the new season, but including that 5 minute cliffhanger single-handedly ruins shows that end up being cancelled.

As it stands, showrunners are trying to write the most unsatisfying conclusion to force another season. This almost feels like they are holding the content for ransom. Release a new season or the content will lose most value, upset the viewers and waste their time.",Futurefied,1647084900.0,2

Back then tons of movies flopped and the ones that were great became classics. No one today wants to take any risks, which is why every thing is rebooted to hell. It's a safe bet. Producers used to do these for the passion. And they probably still do, but netflix and corporate freedom have replaced the genuine people who used to take the risks, and now they are just canceling shows the moment it doesn't bring ratings. I would much much rather have a show be bad and end on a closure than be discontinued.  My favorite show was once called resurrection and I loved it, I was completely disappointed when they canceled it. Sure the ending could have been bad, but I know as a viewer I would want to know what happens. Netflix has now created am unexpected problem( serves them right) because now you have a platform with many unfinished shows nobody will invest their time to watch because they know it has been discontinued.

4014,hv0fmwf,t3_sh2jho,"These stats show 3 things: 

1) a *direct* result of prior articles explaining how Netflix explicitly cancels shows that don’t do well immediately within their first month. People have learned if they want something to stick around, of course they watch it right away and tell their friends - but then what? 

2) People stuck at home for 2yrs who are no longer stuck at home and/or have run out of things to watch. 

3) social media word of mouth moves much faster than tv/movie production

*Of course* people watched all the “hot new shows” right away. That’s the definition of it being a “hot new show”! 
They told all their friends and it becomes a media sensation because there’s nothing else going on. But then what - they watch it again? No, they move on to the next thing. 

A pandemic basically shut down film & tv production worldwide. It took like 3yrs to get Witcher Season 2 out & we haven’t even considered watching it yet because we forgot all about S1 and don’t have the time now. 

Squid Game S2 will probably be terrible because it’s a money grab based solely on S1’s success. It *has to* lack the surprise, uniqueness and shock factor of the original, and it’ll take 2-3yrs to make by which time nobody will care. 

The solution is to stop focusing on “shows” and make movies (or self-contained “limited series”) instead. 

Netflix Original movies have *mostly* been pretty decent (w/some stinkers). But people are sick of having to invest 6, 10, 20hrs in a show to get to the fucking point only to have it canceled one season too early with no resolution. 

If I only have 2hrs to watch something it’s not going to be the slow, plodding character introductions of a 5-season drama that got cancelled after season 3. 

On the flipside of that you have their movies like “The Old Guard” - a unique story, great action sequences, ended w/*potential* for making it a show, but was self-contained and exciting to watch for 2hrs on its own.

The best stuff we’ve watched on Netflix in recent years was limited series like Haunting of Hill House, Squid Game, or even Dark - either it’s wrapped up *enough* in 1 season by design, or it’s *only* 2-3 seasons that are ALL available by the time you sit down to watch it.

I’m a big fan of the old Star Trek and Stargate sci-fi series. X Files was awesome too. Those shows had the same quality. There would be larger season arcs in the plot, but for the most part, you could watch any random episode and enjoy it.

Most importantly for Netflix, if they want to produce series with rewatch potential, they have to replicate this. Everything is bingeable now. There’s no reason to keep replicating that.

Their callous culling of beloved and niche shows that don't reach the impossible targets set by the likes of Stranger Things and The Witcher has only fostered resentment among their userbase.

They also don't really seem to understand how people watch content? I don't hop back and forth between multiple shows very often these days; I'm into the binge format. So when a new season releases it would go into the list until I finish the current binge.

Then Netflix looks at their statistics, which are in part created by the binge watching culture they themselves cultivated, decide new seasons (which they didn't advertise anyway) aren't doing well enough and cut them. Like, they got all these metrics but they don't have a fucking brain, lol?

I will always respect that they pushed for simultaneous global releases with their originals which set a good standard in streaming but they have a strong tendency to burn bridges as they go and I'm tired of getting invested in a show just to see it thrown away.",chipmunk_supervisor,1646925096.0,2

Democrats have done a great job with what they have since they gained a small majority control of the House, an exact 50/50 split in the Senate, with the vice-president being the tie-breaking vote, and the White House. But if the Democrats passed a bill that said the sky is blue, the Republicans would oppose it because Democrats proposed the bill.

A lot of folks who voted for Democrats in 2020 did so on one or two issues, from among several, student loan forgiveness, raising the minimum wage, climate change, voter rights. police reform, and others, now want to walk away, because-they haven’t gotten what they want, yet. Like shooting yourself in the foot.

That wouldn’t be so bad if there were still moderate Republicans controlling that party. But the Republican Party is ready, salivating, to bury those issues and more.

Of course Netflix wants to paint this scenario (that anyone could see coming) as a reason to do an about-face regarding password sharing -- something they once openly endorsed.

So now they want to implement the Hulu model. But the difference here is, Hulu has third party and ***current*** network TV content. That makes it's $7/month a pretty good deal, imo.

Presumably, Netflix will still continue with its current model, which is old, rarely-changing movies, short series (that they cancel often) and documentaries, a couple/few old, ~~cone~~ once popular tv shows, a once-in-a-while *actual* original move or short series and a bunch of foreign (to the US) short series and movies and they bill as ""Netflix Originals.""

I don’t like watching the same type of thing over and over again. I don’t think many people do. It’s predictable and boring.

I want to try new and interesting things and Netflix seems to be the total opposite of this. Same problem with Google and loads of internet services, I just think it’s a complete business case misnomer that they assume “hey this person likes X, give them more X”.  This might work for a month but then I’m done with X and I want to move on, but big web companies just don’t seem to understand that.


Paying a subscription to have my content discovery throttled down to “stuff that’s a lot like stuff you’ve already seen” is stupid.

The first week of Netflix is really cool there’s loads of choice, but the more targeted it gets the worse it gets you have to scroll past pages of copy pasta content to find something new and interesting.

All big web companies do the same thing. I just find that these past few years the internet has become a really mundane content carousel, content discovery is totally broken because it’s monetised on bad assumptions and false pretensions.

They aren’t tracking your location. That wouldn’t even make sense since Netflix is on mobile and tons of different devices many of which don’t support location services, and most of the ones that do require your permission to track.

What they are actually doing is offering to to sell your buddies or grandmas logins which let them use your account more or less like it was their own for a fraction of the price, and as a bonus you don’t have to worry about potential security implications of password sharing.

(Invasive Advertising and Data Selling should be criminal)  


Edit: So, replies to this notion seem to be pretty divided, so maybe I should explain more of what i mean when I say Advertising should be illegal. 

I do not think it should be illegal for information about products or services to be available, primarily via a means where you can go search actively for products and services - the client/consumer should be the one actively going to look, not the company trying to get in front of as many eyeballs as possible.  


What I feel should be illegal are duplicitous, misleading, and emotionally manipulative advertising content, especially when put in front of non-consenting eyes. Already, when what I'm doing is interrupted by advertisements every five minutes, all it's doing is wasting my time and actively making me loathe the advertisers even more.

Exclusive titles like Last of Us, Days Gone, Horizon, Spiderman, God of War, Ghosts of Tsushima, Uncharted, Infamous, to me, have pushed gaming as a serious medium (alongside 3rd party titles like Red Dead 2 of course) and that's important but so is the ability to enjoy multiplat. It already irritates me that I may never play a Prey or Fallout sequel unless I get a gaming PC or an XBox, and not that I even buy Activision games, but this buyout signals a really dark turn.

Out of all they have on Netflix currently, I have two series they have I'm interested in watching. I'm not much of a re-watch person, unless it's both really interesting and I had not seen it in a while. Once I've finished watching said series, I might go another month of not watching.

If it wasn't for my wife and our roommate, I may ditch Netflix, and watch my two series elsewhere that is cheaper. The only thing Netflix has going for them, vs the other streaming services we have, that works on the console/tv, is no ads.

I just hate their per-channel billing, it drives me nuts seeing 4.99 and 5.99 randomly every week over a month (each is a monthly payment, but feels like something is charged twice), and have to dig through Amazon to find out which is which, and if we are still using said channel.

I have found that Netflix is no better or worse than any other set of TV stations with their creations/licensing, but you do sometimes have to wade through some crap.  I have Prime that I barely use for video, save for a couple shows like Mrs. Maisel, Expanse, etc., and some extra free ones. This is MORE than enough when you have a moderately active lifestyle that's beyond sitting in front of the TV.

Recent Netflix shows (or shows that are exclusively on Netflix these days) that I found worth watching over the past 3 years:

\- Stranger Things

\- Squid Game

\- Lost in Space

\- Umbrella Academy

\- The Witcher

\- Cowboy Bebop (kinda)

\- Cobra Kai

\- Sweet Tooth

\- Great British Baking Show

\- Tiger King 1/2

\- The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

\- The Silent Sea

\- Never Have I Ever

\- Sex Education

\- Peaky Blinders

\- Fyre

\- Always Be My Maybe

\- Locke & Key

\- 14 Peaks

\- Somebody Feed Phil

\- Ballad of Buster Scruggs

*****
> Researchers have managed to pack a quantity of data equivalent to 28,000 Blu-Rays inside a single 12-cm optical disk.

> In an article published in the Science Advances journal, the researchers argue that, while laser-enabled optical data storage offers the best option to meet the growing data demands, the differactive nature of light has limited the size of the information bits that can be recorded, in turn limiting the storage capacity of the optical disks.

> &quot;While advances are needed to optimize the technology, the results open new avenues to address the global challenge of data storage. The technology is suited to the mass production of optical disks, so that the potential is enormous,&quot; the researchers claim.

5374,gvau8wv,t3_mv7gmd,"Disney+ and the others have cost them.I like Netflix, but as an Australian there's just too much Bollywood and foreign content as they seem desperate to just grab any content so they have content.(I'm sure indians and asians would be annoyed if 90% of their Netflix content was all Aussie TV shows and movies or just English and nothing else in general, which I doubt it is.)

I have no problems with foreign cinema, and watch a lot of subbed movies and shows, but I still need content I can relate to, enjoy and can watch without reading (or listen to a bad dub where the dub doesn't match the original script and changes a lot story wise.)  
Mind you it's always a no for Indian content, I have tried but it's just not for me.  


Alas most now is foreign, political correct diversity non-sense, or emo teen stuff (with magic of course) and more often than not just recycled over and over so it feels like a real limited selection of genres to choose from. Just no variety anymore, not that they had a lot of variety for Aussie Netflix to begin with. (and they constantly block VPN's to prevent you getting a better catalog to watch for your money.) And it's too late putting on a new film or show 12 months after I've already watched it elsewhere especially when they offer the show in a format like Seasons 1, 5, 8, 10. Or a season of the 'best of's'

If you cannot license an entire series, please don't license it at all.

Such a shame because Netflix content generally has decent production values, it's the story lines or actors that are usually awful.

Honestly there's too much to list with what's wrong with Netflix now. But they need to make some drastic changes to how they do business if they want to survive in a now over flooded market where you need about $1000 worth of subs a month to watch every you want to watch legally.

They should maybe start with understanding what their veiwers want, and if you pander to the minority, you're gonna lose the majorities money.Cannot run a business on feels.

There are so many other streaming services competing now, that being average is not going to cut it anymore. Very very few people would be willing to subscribe to everything so they need to start making more ""diverse"" and solid content. More focused on all age groups. Making super hyped up successful shows is rarified air (I understand that), but even without having to reliably create major wins they can add value to their service in other ways (like bring back all my old movies and tv shows again, stuff that none of their competitors carry anymore without charging you per view on them).

I'm old-fashioned I guess as I still buy Blu-Ray's and DVDs and even CDs. Don't have to worry about those being moved to other new streaming services or delisted or removed from streaming because of licensing or having episodes removed or changed or that sort of stuff. I can always rip them and have them readily accessible too, using this forgotten tech called local storage. 

It's a bigger up-front cost, of course. I'd rather pay $200 for a Blu-Ray Box-Set than pay a streaming subscription for a single television show, and at least I know that What I got isn't going to change. Episodes of shows or movie scenes or whatever aren't going to disappear from my physical media or ripped storage file sets, or suddenly turn into Laserdiscs and require me to buy a laserdisc player (rough analogy to moving to other services).

And I can watch them forever basically. It's a perpetual license. I can rip the physical discs to Video files and use them pretty much however I want. (Except, of course, distribution!), and I don't have to keep paying for a service every month to maintain access to them.

Streaming has always sort of felt like an affluence I suppose.

Netflix's business model is; Let the viewers decide when to watch something instead of watching 'live'.

> According to Reuters, the ISP is suing Netflix to pay up for using so much bandwidth and the maintenance costs due to traffic surges stemming from the streaming giant.

> In the blog, Netflix says it&#039;s been a &quot;Platform for the spread of new Hallyu culture through shows like Kingdom, Vincenzo, and even the recently premiered Squid Game.&quot; It also touted that Squid Game is the first Korean series to make it to the No. 1 spot on Netflix US.As for where all this is coming from? Earlier in June, a South Korean court sided against Netflix in a case where the streaming company argued that SK Broadband had no grounds to demand bandwidth fees.

Hulu in particular has been eating their lunch by capturing really popular third-party content, meaning that when their in-house content misses, they have little to fall back on. Here are a few shows that Netflix lost to Hulu:

* 30 Rock
* Don't Trust the B In Apartment 23
* The X Files
* Bob's Burgers
* Scrubs
* Firefly
* Buffy the Vampire Slayer
* Lost
* The Golden Girls
* Full House (shocking given that Netflix is making the fucking successor!)

They also managed to lose the bidding on Seinfeld and This Is Us (and many more, but these are the biggies), and lost exclusivity on Archer.

These may not be the kind of shows that *attract* people, but they retain people. They're the comfortable favorites people watch time and time again. You can't totally avoid this kind of content, or you just become another single-creator content outfit that fails so consistently (how many of you are subscribers to FX+? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?).

And lastly-- Hulu has done a ton to get competitive on plans, with their no ad plan a dollar more than the Netflix standard plan. Plus, they've got deals for live TV, HBO, and Showtime as a la carte add-ons.

I hated Hulu for the longest time, and their interface is a fucking joke, but it's most of what we watch now, except for briefly binging Netflix originals. It's not hard to see how a couple bad months of new content could really hurt them when they've let their safety net lapse to their strongest competition.",troglodyte,1531856076.0,3

A title that better reflects the article would be that Netflix' growth has slowed due to lacks in quantity and quality of content.  

But if we just try for accuracy instead of matching title to the article, a more accurate title would be ""Netflix growth finally slows"".  Or with a more neutral tone, ""Netflix growth slows"".  

Words matter.  Twisting the article to suit a more clickable title is the lowest form of clickbait.  The twisting here being the omission of scope and context.   The article doesn't mention that NFLX also recovered much of the share price within a day to bring it to $379.  

And it doesn't mention that this $379 is up from $217 six months ago, and from $183 a year ago.  A short dip after quarterly reports is by no means falling off a cliff except in the most myopic of views.   Subscriptions are still growing, just not as fast as expected (they only added 5m+ subscribers instead of the 6m that was projected). 

Journalists, bloggers, you lose credibility with your audience when you leave these things out because they don't support the claims of your article title.  At best, your content looks like click-bait.  At worst, it could look like a hit piece pushing some agenda.  

Now, all of that said..  I agree with the thrust of the article's content: the lack of quality content is probably the biggest factor in the recent results they reported (and spurred the price correction).  And it will be for a while yet.  I just can't agree with the hyperbolically pessimistic portrayal of current financial position. 
 

Netflix and their investors have legitimate reasons to be worried about content.  There are multiple TV networks backing Hulu, and Disney, which is several TV networks in its own right, is coming around the corner.  Even a couple of the single networks like CBS are bopping around with their dunce cap on and thinking they can make a go of streaming.  

The only thing these older competitors can fight with is content (and to a lesser degree, user experience, which doesn't matter without the content).  Well..  ***could*** have fought with, I should say.  Now net neutrality is gone, and the distribution channels that have been partners of the TV networks for decades get to join the competitive battle.  If the current trend of ISP behavior continues, they will eventually weigh in on the media battle by punishing users who don't use a preferred delivery channel (see: artificial scarcity, data caps, paid prioritization).  

Of course, they'll phrase it as 'rewarding loyalty' or as some perk of being their customer. But really they're just stealing a pair of your socks and then giving one sock back to you as a gift.  This can't work unless bandwidth is scarce, though.  Bandwidth is not scarce at that level, at all, if the infrastructure is properly maintained.   If you can charge more when bandwidth is scarce, though, you create incentive to allow infrastructure to decay. Why spend the money to keep up with customer usage when you can not only avoid that expense but also charge both the user and the partner service more instead?  Forget ever taking a step beyond maintenance into building something new.  

The decay of our infrastructure is only good for the major stockholders of the oligopolies that own the key pieces of it.

The truth is, Netflix maintained at its current state can probably weather the loss of net neutrality alone, if it can keep to status quo with content.  But it's not just the one problem.  Artificially created risks are rising along both critical tiers of distribution and content as their dependencies are used against them.  It's like a pincer attack from multiple sides of a deeply intertwined industry.  And content creation is key to overcoming it.  

The great hope for them is their rapid growth, bucket loads of cash, and ability to adapt more quickly to shifts in technology.  I think adaptability will be key, but we're seeing signs here that they are struggling with it.   They're probably finding that their technical capability which worked so well up to this point might not have equipped them to introduce the same sort of innovation to creative processes that build content like great television shows.  

But, yeah, although they've had a great year and are still growing, that growth has slowed.  There's so much more interesting stuff to say about this topic..  spinning the article (via selective information scope and omission) to match a less accurate but more click-grabby title is laziness or incompetence to such a degree that it borders deception.

Content is not a strong moat, and without a moat you have zero pricing power and crappy margins. If I can get decent enough content on Disney+ with ads or with my Amazon Prime subscription then why wouldn't I just find stuff to watch there?

They need find other monetisation streams or to build out a more fully-featured streaming platform. What Disney does right is that content is just a starting point. If your kid likes Frozen or Marvel they're going to want all the Frozen and Marvel gizmos for Christmas, and they're going to beg you all year to take them to Disney World. Disney only cares about content as much as it provides them with unique IP that they can sell experiences and products with pricing power. It drives me nuts that I have to spend £30 on some crappy plastic Marvel toy every Christmas, but that's the genius of what Disney does, if your kid wants the latest spiderman toy, you're probably going to buy it regardless of price. This probably why Disney is fine with an ad model. They can lose money on the content itself so long as they can make enough money elsewhere from that content.

I'm not sure Netflix can replicate the theme park & merch model of Disney, but they could explore alternatives like video games and include that in their subscription. If Netflix offered me a library of video content, video games, music & audiobooks, I'd probably be more happy to pay their prices -- especially if it meant I could cancel my Spotify subscription. As it stands the only reason I still pay for Netflix is because my girlfriend likes to watch Friends on there. It's a total waste of money, but I cba to argue about it.

Bill buys XYZ at $150, and it drops to $100.  Now, if Tom buys at $100, would Tom ever say, ""I will only sell at $150 because that's where Bill breaks even""?   No, because Bill's entry price has nothing to do with Tom or the stock.  Tom does not even know about Bill.  Likewise, your own past entry price has nothing to do with the stock's current or future performance.  You are Bill, and the rest of the world is Tom.

Let's now say you never bought at $150, and you first discover the stock at $100, would you come fresh and buy today and say, ""I will sell at $150"".  No, you are not even aware that it traded at $150, and that is now a totally random number from thin air, and has nothing to do with the stock trading at $100 today.   You are Tom.  In both cases, you are buying at $100, but with totally different targets, one because of a random personal action in the past, that is totally disconnected from the actual stock prospects today.

Refusing to take a loss?  (""Only a paper loss"")?  To be clear, I am not saying you must sell, but understand the money is already gone.  Your brokerage statement says your account balance using today's price, not your entry price.    Ignoring tax implications, you are effectively buying back the stock at today's price.    Every day.   Hold if you're still bullish, or maybe DCA more if you're really bullish.  As they say, if you liked it at $150, then you really like it at $100.But, if you do not like it anymore, you still still ""buying"" it at $100, simply by still holding it.  Every day.  Also, what if the stock goes to $125?  Do you sell now?  Or is the $150 past affecting your decision making?   What if you never bought it at $150?  Now $100 to $125 is treated differently than $150 to $100 to $125.  Yet, it's the same move from $100 to $125.You also miss out on other opportunities while waiting to hit a totally arbitrary personal target that only matters to your brain only.

""You shouldn't sell low"" is absolute trash advice and I assume that the one giving that advice isn't too experienced.

You've written the answer yourself. 

When the decision to buy a stock is made, you come up with a theory, a thesis, about how the company will perform in the future and where that should put the stock price at a fair valuation. There are other criteria, of course, but this is really what it boils down to if we wanna simplify. 

Now fundamentals can change and your thesis can turn out wrong. If that's the case you re-evaluate. If that re-evaluation tells you that the  price/return you're looking for are very unlikely, or that the fundamentals have changed in a way that puts the fair price below the  price you bought the stock at (and not significantly above the current one), chances are the decision to sell is a good one.

Waiting for a ""significant green"" day is a bit tricky. The stock might sell off a lot more until then. You may get greedy after seeing a big green day and wait for another one - and you receive a pullback instead. Or you might even tell yourself that this is the time the stock rallies back to where it once was without looking at fundamentals.

Wanting to sell on a green day isn't wrong, just be cautious to not act on emotions.

When to sell is also a question of opportunity. Should you wait for a big green day when there are other stocks you feel are very attractive right now? Probably better to rotate right away.

Netflix is odd in that it seemed to take a huge dive as a byproduct of what I could only describe as a large, negative media campaign around a tiny (0.1%) subscriber loss in Q1 2022 (a first for Netflix).  It sounds bad until you look at the numbers and realize that subscriber growth rate is largely linear all the way back to 2013, has had numerous near zero growth quarters (just never negative), had an unusually high Q4 2021 growth, and the current subscriber count is completely inline with is linear trend.  Q1 2022 isn't even an outlier at all.  In fact, they're still above trend.  So the 200,000 subscriber news onslaught seems totally stupid.

Pair this with record high revenue and near record high profit in Q1 2022, the media and stock drop seems very off.  It feels more like a deliberate corporate attack than a natural event.

On a side note, some might argue price increases or competition eating away market share.  However, Netflix has always raised prices every couple years.  This new price increase is not unusual and not out of line with standard behavior.  Also, subscriber count has been historically insensitive to rate increases.  It has never historically shown any exodus after any of the many price increases.  Additionally, subscriber count has also been completely insensitive to any influx of new competition.  There has never been a drop in subscriber count when new streaming services come into the market, even major players.  People just don't trade one service for another.  Data shows they just buy both.

Netflix subscriber count is the highest in the industry.  Subscriber growth rate is also steeper than others, well, except Disney+, because Disney, and again they're not actually competing.",mvw2,1651667811.0,4

- management doesn’t know what they’re doing, their OC is bad, they’ll keep losing money

Thanks for your non financial advice, much appreciated, cheers!

In my opinion.  Your friend missed the boat to sell Netflix at a good price.  Over the pandemic people were LOCKED in their homes.  They needed something to do.  SO, everyone bought netflix.

That being established.  Netflix will never have an earnings better than 2020.  So, market makers are going to hold it against them for years.  Maybe 5 to 10 years.  So, it could be awhile for netflix to go on another run.

I checked the magic 8 ball and it says.  ""Outlook not good""

The best I could say is it might be ""stabilizing"".  Netflix market cap is at 60 billion and it has the revenue of 30 billion.  They have money in the bank.  But, they also have debt.  The stock could literally go down to 50 bucks before it flattens out.",Impairedinfinity,1651679827.0,1

5947,i5kpw74,t3_u7xqd8,"Netflix made six major mistakes I can think of:

1.)They didn't lock down established IP when they had a chance.  They rented, rather than bought.  Now, maybe not every IP holder would have sold in perpetuity, but enough probably would have ... especially if it wasn't exclusive, to make a big difference.  Bit by bit Netflix basically lost the entirety of their worthwhile movie library and most of their television library (AMC excluded).  

2.)They tried to pivot into their own in-house movie and TV production, and unlike a company like HBOMax or Disney, they don't have an established creative hierarchy that knows what the fuck they're doing.  They basically paid hundreds of millions of dollars for unending garbage.  What's even worse, they continuously canceled shows they had created before their runs had ended ... which creates a cycle of pissed off customers unwilling to invest their time in the next show for fear it will also be axed early. 

3.)They raised prices and cracked down on usability while the service got worse.  Bad combination.

4.)When they began to lose content, they didn't actually pivot into a space where their funding and bandwidth could have allowed them a new way to dominate: news and sports.  Their steadfast decision to remain a rental and production house when their rental wing essentially died (as companies pulled back their IP) has been disastrous.

5.)They decided to become political activists.  Whether you agree or disagree with the socio-political positions they have taken as a company, the reality is that when a corporation takes a stand they're going to make someone mad.  

6.)They didn't return shareholder value in the form of dividends or stock buybacks.  I took a hard look at Netflix back in February or March of this year, thinking I might be buying a dip, but I concluded the stock was still massively overvalued.

So far subscription momentum is hanging in there, as the price hike more than offsets the subscriber loss.  But I think this year will be a turning point.

The popular sentiment now is to be skeptical of any new Netflix show because it can be canceled without story closure, and that most Netflix content is derivative.

6065,i5nicxc,t3_u8qa28,"Subscriptions have been nearly linear since 2013.  Q1 2022 is NOT below this linear trend.

Subscription revenue from subscribers and price has steadily risen with two distinct increase spikes in mid 2017 and Q1 2022 at their new rate.

Subsections have not historically dropped off due to price increases.

There have been several quarters in the past that were a near zero rise too.  Q1 20222 just happened to to the first instance below zero.  Q4 2021 was also a higher than average increase, and the negative is likely just dumb luck in timing with more jumping on late Q4 rather than early Q1.

The high volume of media seems...targeted.  There's a huge negative narrative around really mild and entirely inline numbers.

Netflix is still the biggest streaming service by a significant margi margin.  Hulu is much lower and growing slower.  Disney+ is lower but the only one growing faster...because Disney.  HBO and HBO Plus is much lower and nearly flat and stagnant for growth.  Amazon Prime is the only thing that matches Netflix, but Prime also covers many other things besides streaming.

People might complain about spending, but that's also the side of the equation they have full control over.  So the numbers here are deliberate.  The one thing they can't control is subscriptions, and that's STILL inline with the long term trend. AND they're making the most revenue they ever had, today.

But it's dinner' somehow all bad, scary scary, and the stock tanked for...reasons???

Even after the recent earnings, the company literally has no serious plan to deal with subscriber issue other than password sharing restrictions, and its all a distraction from bigger issues. They proposed introducing an ad-based Netflix plan which obviously won't be welcomed by many and based on the outrageous pricing they have been doing even prior to their recent price increase, I can expect an ad-based plan to be still too expensive.

Another major issue with Netflix is their original content. They have cancelled good shows, lost licences to many shows, which makes it important to put out quality content yet they are currently focusing on producing large quantity of content rather than quality.

The issue is that they're probably going to have to spend money making more premium content before they're able to really last on their own two feet. If they keep spending hundreds of millions on IP like Knives Out and not doing anything with it, any confidence I have is gone.

Netflix released their earnings report after the market closed on 4/19. They beat the earnings per share but their revenue dropped and missed. But the bad news was they lost a large number of customers globally AND they expect to lose MORE customers during 2022. Now, would you invest in a company that was projecting to lose more and have a reduced profit? 

That is what happened. And many people tried to sell their stocks as soon as the report was released. Many saw the price drop 20% before a sell order could take place because the results were so bad. But understand, if the news were great, you might have seen a price spike.

While the aftermarket and premarket are more risky trading times, it does allow for market movements to take place. And if it is a significant movement, it could affect the market opening price. Remember, in order for a trade to exist, there must be a buyer and seller at an agreed price.

Third, their huge global reach is largely based on poor'ish people sharing access codes, so one paying sub delivers Netflix to 20-30 people.  My condo in Mexico recently cut off Netflix service because Netflix was forcing them to buy a different sub for ever unit when previously one sub took care of 40 units.  My Colombian girlfriend long watched Netflix on borrowed or stolen codes, that is how they all do it down here in Latin America.

So, Netflix may have to overhaul itself, but how?  Now WBD and Disney both have better product and PARA, Apple and Amazon are about equal.

Costs of production are getting higher and higher
Linked to point 2, they are not making money through merch
Decision to ban sharing accounts might make them lost even more subscribers
In an inflationary environment people might choose to tighten the belt and cancel some of their streaming services.

For context, forty years ago I had a colleague who was a counseling psychologist in a small college. He loved his job and he loved playing golf and watching golf on TV. One Monday, he noticed that for the third Monday in a row, he was coming to work depressed. He'd never been subject to depression before. He liked his job. What was going on?

The next Sunday, he was watching televised golf again and found his mood changing. He realized that it was the ads that were bringing him down. The products were all aspirational items for high earners: the high-end cars, watches, the most expensive golf clubs.

My friend realized that the ad worked by making himself crave things that he'd never be able to have with his psychologist's salary. The ads function as generators of dissatisfaction.

He quite watching golf, and his depression went away.

[Multiple credit rating agencies have already said they are taking a second look at Twitter’s debt rating as the Musk acquisition pushes forward.](https://fortune.com/2022/04/26/twitter-debt-elon-musk-possible-credit-downgrade/)

Moody’s said on Tuesday that its rating for Twitter, Ba2, *which is just barely above a junk rating already*, is under review due to the increasing debt burden of the social media giant. And S&P Global Ratings put its BB+ rating for Twitter on watch as well this week, noting that the *Musk deal would push the company’s net leverage—a ratio of debt to earnings—past the 1.5 times threshold that would trigger a downgrade.* 

Musk personally took out a $12.5 billion margin loan to help finance his buyout, backing the move with $62.5 billion of his Tesla shares. Were Tesla's stock to drop by 40%, Musk would have to pony up the cash to pay back the loan, according to regulatory filings.   
  
That adds risk for Twitter, and for Tesla shareholders, White said.  
  
“Because that collateral is underlying the margin loan, if something were to happen, and Twitter struggled to service the debt, or if Tesla stock price drops, then he could get a collateral call where he might have to sell shares of Tesla,” White said. “*You could imagine a scenario where Tesla shares come down, and Elon has to sell more to maintain the margin loan.”*

[Elon Musk will be the most indebted CEO in America if the Twitter deal goes through](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/elon-musk-will-be-most-indebted-ceo-in-america-if-twitter-deal-closes.html)

Musk’s stock debt is outsized relative to the entire stock market. His shares pledged before the Twitter deal account for more than a third of the $240 billion of all shares pledged at all companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to Audit Analytics. With the Twitter borrowing, that debt could soar even higher.",DangerStranger138,1652243968.0,3

I think that what Netflix needs to do to save themselves is to start focusing more on producing high quality content instead of just pumping out mediocre quantity.

Netflix currently cares more about always having some new content even if the new content is junk, and I think that their approach is a mistake and will no longer work as well now that the competition with strong reputations for producing high-quality shows has arrived with their own streaming services. Building strong fan communities around a few high-quality shows that people get heavily invested in and then rewarding those fanbases by not pre-maturely canceling the shows is a much better approach that Netflix needs to adopt.",StarWolf478,1650754460.0,3

6576,htj9v6e,t3_s8t1or,"Just cancelled my subscription. 

Their licensed catalogue is weak, especially compared to their competitors (HULU, HBOMax, and Disney)

Their originals aren’t very good. They get a couple of hits here and there (Squid game, Stranger Things) but compared to HBO which has a consistent track record of producing the best TV ever made it’s paltry. 

Now they’ve upped the price to $20/mo. The only competitive advantage I give Netflix is their user experience is the best hands down, but I will gladly navigate a clunky UI if the service actually has stuff I want to watch. The other big advantage they have is international presence. They are already in a lot more countries that HBO which is still beholden to old licensing deals with legacy cable companies in places like the UK and Australia. 


IMO Netflix needs a big pivot in their production strategy. When they broke into the streaming game their product was seen as a better cheaper alternative to Cable. This was true mostly because the cable companies hadn’t realized the full value of their existing IP. They saw Netflix as just as another form of syndication. Netflix actually anticipated the cable companies next move quite well, they understood that they would eventually pull their best IP (or raise the licensing price significantly, $500 million for *Seinfeld*) and they went hard developing their own IP or acquiring distribution rights. 

But the mistake they made IMO, is that they created their content with the idea of attracting cord cutters not making the best content. So they went in hard on replicating the variety of a cable subscription, reality shows, cooking shows, travel shows, teen shows, action, comedies, fantasy, sci fi. Instead of trying to make the best content they settled for producing the most. With the idea being that they needed to fill their catalogue ASAP to replace all of the licensed content that would be leaving. They forewent quality for quantity. Its hard for me to justify paying $20/mo for the one show that Netflix produces that might be good and tbh piracy readily fills that hole. The Witcher was the third most pirated show of 2021.

Luckily they have oodles of cash, the best streaming technology, but as a tech first company it’s glaringly obvious that their weakness lies in their content production. Just because you can poach people from other networks with your big salaries and loaded stock options doesn’t mean you have the expertise.

Netflix IMO is still in the lead, but that lead has been cut dramatically from what it was just three years ago.",theummeower,1642726580.0,-6

It's no longer unique in a world that streams - despite it paving most of that road initially. Other options are more affordable and seem to provide comparable content, if not better (for instance, Disney+). 

With more competition we'd expect subscription price to go down, not up unless more value is provided, but this doesn't seem to be the case. 

- Stale content with potential ads (an ad-less experience was one of the major aspects that pushed it along in the beginning) doesnt seem attractive, especially when other options don't. 

- Cracking down on account sharing. It's easy to see where they're coming from here, but its also easy to see that most people will just simply discontinue using it once this happens (in the mind of consumers, they may think ""I provided access to my family for x price, now I'd have to pay double or triple to have that same benefit ...just so that they can scroll endlessly and maybe not watch anything"" - negative value). They require a more intelligent solution here.

Netflix currently has ZERO content I want to watch. In fairness I do like some of their originals, but that is only good for short binge-watching. Their non-original content is absolute dog crap. It used to be so much better before all the competition heated up.

Had I just held my nose in Amazon, Google, Chipotle, or Netflix I would have made a fortune. By the same token, investing in a company with crap products and a cheap share price is likely a loser.

Netflix estimates that 100m non-subscribers are using Netflix accounts, and they seem to have a plan to attempt to monetize those users.

6658,i7zuibm,t3_um4q0l,"Personally, I see NFLX as an odd one.  There was a big media blitz touting massive losses in subscribers, the platform getting swamped by other streaming services...

...and then you look at the data, and none of the media makes any sense.

Subscribers is a linear trend since 2013.  It's growth rate is more rapid than any other streaming platform besides Prime and Disney+.  Prime is a mix of many other services.  Disney+ is just, well, Disney.  Everyone's going to buy that.  Even so, all streaming services are half or less of the subscribers, and outside of the two all have shallower growth curves.  The 200,000 subscriber dip (0.1%) is 100% inline with the trendline and looks to be mostly a byproduct of Q4 2021 being an unusually high growth.  So basically, people bought late Q4 instead of early Q1.  Media also ignores that Netflix has had many near 0 growth quarters.  This just happens to be the first and just happens to be after a record growth quarter in Q4.

Media touts raising prices, but Netflix has raised prices every couple years for forever.  This isn't new, nor out of line with standard practice for them.  Also, history shows they don't lose subscribers from price increases.  Subscription growth remains strong and nearly linear in groth, even through price changes.

Media toutes competitors sapping away Netflix subscribers, but the numbers don't show that at all.  In fact, it shows no streaming service seems to be affected by new competition.  Basically, people aren't buying one or the other.  People are buying both, or three, or four, etc.  No streaming service seems to drop customers when a new one, or several crop up.  Consumers do not see these products as competitors, not really.  They don't according to their wallets.

Revenue is at a record high.  Earnings was low Q4 but normal relative to a lot of previous quarters.  Earnings was back to near record highs in Q1 despite the stock crashing like the company is a pile of trash.

So tons of subscribers, tons of revenue, tons of profit, outpacing the competition still, no real downside at all, and...the stock tanked, hard.  It dropped a ton and then dropped like 40% in one day.  I bought in after that, and it's been one of the better stocks I have now as the market bleeds out.",mvw2,1652145997.0,24

From an average consumer perspective in America, why would I not cancel it and either: A) Subscribe when a big show comes out then cancel immediately, or B) Pirate all of their shit

They peaked about 4-5 years ago and now they’re reaping what they’ve sown. Plus, if we’re speaking about emotional reactions, how about their reaction to all of this? “We’re going to scale back content, the main reason people subscribe in the first place.”

Then, disrupting the industry more by moving to streaming. Sadly, a lot of the larger studios whose films likely account for more than HALF of all popular films in existence got smart and decided to launch their own platforms. To combat this, Netflix has been forced to invest HEAVILY in new, original content. While this has worked for the past couple years, the amount of new content (as well as the demand) just cannot keep up with the amount of lost content to other streaming services. If we look back on Netflix's origins with 20/20 hindsight, there really was no ""secret sauce"" so while they were the first to pave the way to affordable, unlimited streaming content, they are also the first to be sacrificed for the other studios/content providers to survive.",LeonardoDiYolio,1650501192.0,3

plan flexibility is a good idea. its part of the reason why the other platforms have (sort of) caught up. the sharing password thing is a no-duh from a corp/investor point of view. I get why customers disagree, but combining with plan flexibility they could easily lower prices for single/double streams and offer their high tier plan as a multi-stream.

im a little concerned about running down the creative budget and I agree with the criticisms that they shut down series too soon. imo Netflix should be a place where obscure series thrive. granted, there is always a cost, but it should strive to maintain that rep rather then a rep of shutting shows down.

internationally, I think Netflix beats all. I personally hate when I see a show that looks awesome, only to learn its in Polish, but most of the world is used to watching American movies with subtitles. which means that awesome polish show has more appeal worldwide than it does to people like me. 

I like HBO, but it isn't the end-all. overall the quality is better, but the selection isn't as vast. I see this as a positive (for HBO) in some ways, but bottom line is that it doesnt really replace Netflix. paramount/peacock/apple are small time. I do the $5 subs because they are almost free (see above). I dont watch Hulu, so I cant comment on it, but I never hear about any really good content on Hulu (other than Handmaids Tale). if there was, it would draw me to it. Prime is... I dont know. it has some good series, but otherwise just seems like a non-player. 

it sucks seeing it drop like this. I am worried. but ive withstood drops before and will again. nothing has really changed for me on Netflix except that it will take a while to grow confidence of many. hopefully this signals to the board that they need to get in gear because its a new landscape. plan flexibility is a big start to that and its not a negative for investor or customer.",crocodial,1650463618.0,4

Content owners were letting Netflix use their content for a fee. And over time the larger content owners have placed large and mostly successful bets on making their content exclusive to their platforms (and removing it from Netflix). Over that time Netflix has ramped up their own content generation business and that will likely keep them solvent for a while, but the massive growth days are over.  They are a content company now, not a platform company. And in the long run places like Disney or paramount have been in the content business for much longer and know how to make/buy good enough content in a financially constrained environment. Netflix will have to show similar abilities to compete financially. 

Tesla has succeeded on its own products from the start. I don’t think they will continue to have a valuation higher than all other auto OEMs combined, but I don’t think they’ll need to shift what their business focuses on fundamentally the way Netflix is having to.

However I would like to give you another perspective.

Apple. In 2007 they come with their own revolutionary phone with its own operating system. Impressive at the beginning and sales reach astronomical numbers at first but everyone said competition will catch up.
Japanese (Sony), Koreans (Samsung, LG) Finnish (Nokia) and Chinese will develop and launch their own phones  make them better and outperform Apple.
Apple will be remembered as the pioneer who made a revolutionary product but will not be there for long.

15 years later the picture is completely different.
Samsung made phones which explode, LG exit smartphone business after suffering losses, Nokia and Sony was never competitor, and Chinese made very good phones (Huawei) but politics destroyed them.

Apple remains the king of smartphones and there is no one to be close to them.

Why you don't consider this could happen on the EV?

All existing manufacturers for one reason or another will fail to deliver (e.g their cars catch fire during charging, or the performance is not match to Tesla) and finally Tesla is the undisputed winner of this new technology.

They’ve secured their position in the market. They sell more than just a car and technology, they sell an image. 

Netflix on the other hand.. once Hulu and Disney came on board people willingly left or signed up for the competitors. Yes, they have fantastic series and original movies, but other competitors are mirroring that model of exclusivity and can easily steal their signed on actors and bid higher for scripts. They don’t have a competitive edge, and they are losing loyalty by punishing existing consumers with higher fees to make up for loss of revenue and potentially introducing lower quality experiences in return for the same price.

VW is building a new “state of the art” factory for its EVs but has ALREADY admitted they think getting that number down to 20 hours is the best they can do.

A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a major cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic selling and underlying economic factors. They often follow speculation and economic bubbles.

I'd find it hard to say this is a major section of the market. Value stocks, energy, utilities, defensive, healthcare, and materials have held up well, or are up. I haven't seen much panic selling. Most down days have been average volume days, so far.

A big drop from ATH but achieved over a prolonged period of days or weeks is a correction between 10% and 20% and a bear market over 20%.

RSI of the VXX isn't even over 60 yet. With inflation running at over 8% the Fed isn't even close to slamming on the breaks with high interest rates, so it isn't likely that inflation will come under control anytime soon. When prices are high and rising, people buy less so that has a slowing effect on the economy and eventually earnings and employment. The market is forward looking and traders/investors aren't happy with what they see in the coming months. This all started just before Thanksgiving at the Weds Fed announcement. That was the peak of bullishness. Since then it's been a steady grind down with occasional spikes up. Almost all asset classes are being sold off, as investors raise cash. There are a few defensive areas that are doing well but the list is short. I have seen this type of action before. Before the 1987 crash, when the Dow dropped 25% in one day, there had been a steady decline in the market for some time. Now, THAT was a crash. The Fed had to step in and inject liquidity. The Barrons headlines said that the computers were jumping out of the windows, rather than investors. A lot of today's market action is algo generated, so the moves can be strong and scary at times. You can always be hedged with some of the bear ETFs like the SQQQ or UVXY. Puts are too expensive now with high implied volatility.

TSMC by far. The world is crawling to a halt because everyone is waiting to buy from them, they are growing fast, but still can't grow fast enough to match the demand on their chips.

They are THE semiconductor manufacturing stock that's somehow also stayed flat since mid-2020 despite insane growth as an undisputed industry leader. All the while chip designers that rely on TSMC to make actual products multiplied their valuations. It's as if Chinese invasion of Taiwan was literally priced in as a given into their current valuation. Except they are spreading their fabs across a range of different countries, including the US.

I'd give my second vote to Netflix. It came crashing and burning on news of a small correction, coming from a lockdown where they solidified their position as the leading platform for movies and TV series and hitting growth to 200 million paying subscribers. They are undervalued due to the market overreaction. They are no longer a growth company, they are the new global media leader. Netflix is transitioning to becoming more akin to a global utility company.

No idea if it is the MOST undervalued, but with a tpe of 5.6; fpe of 5, peg of 0.36, the small/mid cap sports & outdoor apparel and gear retailer looks like a steal. 

all 260 stores in southern states, benefiting from oil booms and thus largely insulated from high inflation/rate hikes (so long as there is no deep recession causing oil price to nosedive), large growth potential in opening new stores, a highly regarded mgmt team with solid track records, robust merchandizing/logistics/omni channel/data analytics capability with a solid balance sheet ...

ASO reported earnings (ER) on 3/29, beat both EPS and REV, guide EPS much higher and REV inline. Share jumped 9-10% at ER and shows relative strength since during the current market pull-back.  Street mainly worried about the demand pull forward and the subsequent drop off in Rev and Eps, that did not happen.

I did a quick and dirty analysis before ASO ER, which showed that Street is being way too negative. As a trader, I long calls into ER and exited after the 9-10% gain post ER.  However, I think long term investors should take a look at the name.  CEO was former FootLocker CEO, delivered a 400% share price gain in 5 years while there. He is using the same play book at ASO to drive the performance.  

If there is one thing I don't like about ASO, is that it hands out huge amount of options and shares to mgmt, causing large dilution which they manage through large share buybacks (so buybacks do not reduce share counts to benefit shareholders).  However, these grants are large performance based, and mgmt clearly has the incentive to push ASO higher - biz and stock price wise.",TraderORyan,1650581822.0,7

7510,iafm79m,t3_v0ajgv,"Benjamin Graham discusses this question in the early chapters of, ""The Intelligent Investor"" when distinguishing between what he refers to as, ""Defensive"" and ""Enterprising"" investors

In modern parlance, we would probably refer to these groups as, ""Passive Investors,"" and ""Active Investors,"" respectively. 

Graham was writing in a time before index funds were available, so for defensive investors he advised them to stick with quality assets, even if they had to pay a small premium to do so. This meant leading large-cap stocks, such as those making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and what he called, ""high-grade bonds,"" which today we might call, ""investment-grade."" 

A defensive investor should trade very little, seeking only to maintain their asset allocation in response to market fluctuations, and the periodic addition of funds from one's paycheck. 

The advice for enterprising investors in the book was much less straight-forward, because the roads to excess returns in any given period are not straight-forward; they vary considerably based on circumstances at the time, and available opportunities. Graham briefly addresses strategies such as merger-arbitrage, which his Graham-Newman fund used with success in its early history. Incidentally, this strategy became very popular in the 1980s and led to many high-level cases of insider-trading in that decade -- read Jame's Stewart's, ""Den of Thieves,"" (1992) for more details. The trouble with active strategies in general, however, is that once the competition learns about them the excess returns tend to disappear, so an enterprising investor is constantly needing to adjust their strategy in search of new sources of alpha. In broad terms then, Graham stated that an enterprising investor is one who is equipped with the proper analytical tools and temperament to reach an independent valuation of virtually any asset, and as such, is able to determine when a security of apparently-inferior quality to the market leaders may, in fact, be undervalued by the market, and thus ripe for revaluation higher once everyone else figures that out. In this sense, the active or enterprising investor might look for undervalued companies among the lower-quality end of the market and hope to earn a higher returns than by simply buying-and-holding the highest quality assets at premium prices.

So to return to your question, I think if you're a defensive investor who doesn't have the analytical training to value a company's assets and cash-flows, you're almost always better off sticking with the highest quality companies in the market, even if those companies come with a premium valuation. The reason other posters have suggested using index funds for this purpose is because this is the simplest and easiest-to-scale method for carrying out this kind of operation for the vast majority of individual savers. You could conceivably purchase shares in the largest 30-50 stocks in the market, the way defensive investors in Graham's day would have done it, but why bother when you could simply purchase an index fund and achieve the same result?  

If you want to become an enterprising investor, then you'll want to learn the techniques of valuation so you can come to an independent judgment of an asset's worth. How else will you be able to judge if a security is actually ""cheap,"" rather than fairly priced, it you can't value the security? You can't just look at a few publicly-available statistics and from that alone determine that an asset is cheap or expensive, because everyone else is looking at the same things and pricing the asset accordingly. You have to come to an independent view about what the asset is worth; that view needs to be different from the market's, making the security mispriced; and that view ultimately needs to be correct in the way you expect. In markets with many intelligent competitors with large budgets, such as the US equity market, this is very difficult to do. You can try it, of course, but if you do so, you should have a thorough understanding of the techniques of valuation, and a willingness to work quite hard, because that is what your competition is doing every day. 

In my view then, if you don't know how to independently value a company's assets and cash-flows, that's fine; but you should probably be a defensive investor, and the simplest way of doing that today is by purchasing an index fund for minimal fees. If you're well-trained in the techniques of valuation, however, and don't mind spending your time analyzing securities, then you might find excellent returns for relatively low risk among the lists of the second and third-rate issues. Good luck.",Musashi_13,1653836439.0,19
7511,iag9x6t,t3_v0ajgv,"Undervalued stocks are the way to go. Every investment is the present value of all future cash flow. Doesn’t matter what company makes the money, a dollar is a dollar. 

Never look at the market cap of a company to determine whether or not it is a market leader. TSLA is the car company with the largest market cap, but they delivered 1 tenth of the number of vehicles as Toyota.

C has 80% of the revenue BAC has, but has 1/3 the market cap, obviously there’s more to take into account. Such as margins, growth etc.

Doesn’t matter what the market cap of the stock is. You’re buying a piece of a business, and you want to buy it as cheap as possible.

Don’t use P/E as a measure of cheap vs expensive. Use a discounted future free cash flow model, and give conservative growth numbers so you don’t overpay.",gottahavetegriry,1653847108.0,11
7512,iafdk1f,t3_v0ajgv,"Probably best to read and learn a lot before picking. There is no definitive answer to your question. Or, well, the answer is ""It depends"".

If a company trades at a higher P/E multiple than it's competitors, but is expected to far exceed their performance for years and years to come, it might not actually be overvalued by those expectations, even if it's seemingly trading rich.

Likewise, there can be reasons for a company trading cheap. It can be actually undervalued but it's also possible that there are issues with the company, concerns over the future performance, their finances, whatever.

So if you wanna pick stocks, do just that. Look at the companies, one after the other, and try to figure out where they are going and what expectations are, what the sentiment is, how execution has been and so on. Then come up with a fair valuation according to the assumptions you make and determine where the company should be trading in X years if your assumptions are correct. From that price and the current price you can determine an expected rate of return. By doing that, you can determine which company you expect to be the best deal.

Once you've done your DD, feel free to share it here. People will read it, some will comment to criticise mistakes or point out what you might have missed. With that, you'll likely have a better overall picture.

You can't say that this or that is better in general. You gotta look at every company individually if you wanna be a successful stock picker. My personal opinion is that people often overpay a lot because a company is the leader in their sector, and that this often diminishes their return. There can, however, be a sensible premium on leaders at times that still make them the better buy even if they are trading somewhat rich compared to others in the sector.

And be aware that successful stockpicking is hard. It's really difficult to beat the S&P 500 consistently over many years, most people aren't able to do that.",DRMRCX,1653832286.0,33

Third, be careful how you’re viewing sectors. Entertainment is the sector, streaming is just a delivery service. Some of them are also content providers, etc. streaming competes with cable, ota and movie theaters. Content providers have a different set of competitors. So if you relook at those names you listed and think of the entertainment sector, DIS is the real king. At least for me it puts it into a different perspective.

7883,hbxk6am,t3_pjlah0,"There's plenty of room for other EV makers to succeed along with Tesla. Most of the other automakers are only aiming for 50% of their sales to be electric by 2030, and that includes hybrid and plug in hybrid, let alone fully electric.

Tesla are aiming for 20-25% vehicle market share by 2030, so that leaves another 25% of the market up for grabs. However in terms of innovation, Tesla are miles ahead of the pack, and their lead is increasing. I can't see another automaker taking the lead from them this decade.

Toyota will not be a leader because they haven't realised the future is electric yet. GM and Ford aren't doing enough and are at risk of bankruptcy this decade. I do think Volkswagen will be a prominent player as they realise how far ahead Tesla are and have a bit more urgency to get the EV ball rolling.

It might reach 100 trillion (random number generator) market cap before that, who knows? But, if it's a market that anyone can get in, and there are already a huge bunch of players in it then competition will be strong. Unlike Netflix that created a market on its own, Tesla is just trying to enter an existing market with something new and different. VW group, Toyota group and others that are already in the group, will just switch to electric (or Hydrogen Fuel cells which probably is more environmentally friendly ) and capitalize on user loyalty For example I personally am not buying any car that is not Toyota. I own a Toyota Corrola from 2006. Quite often I forget to change the engine oil, neglect taking it for service and maintenance, take it off road, to mountains, to gravel, to rocks, hit it a few times here and there, scratches everywhere, and I it has 300 000 km on it.

The service cost is around 100 euros, which I'm supposed to do every 10k km but I usually go at 15k because I forget. Other brands cars would have been dead by now (my friends all switched cars because their previous ones died) or the service cost will be triple, or both (friend of mine, owns a golf, bought it 3 years ago, does the same amount of km as me per year, but obviously a lot less in total, and so far has paid around 10k euros in repairs).

So yeah, Tesla might be the ""first"" but it will not be alone, it's not even alone now. Netflix started something new, it was alone and capitalized on that. Tesla is just Elon Musk hype.

\*\*EDIT\*\* When I said Hydrogen cars, I meant Hydrogen Fuel cells which still an EV but does not have the environmental impact of disposing batteries when they are done.

Additionally, the fact that you suggested Toyota makes the whole question even more ridiculous. Toyota is one of the few legacy automakers who's actively working AGAINST the transition to EVs and hardly making the transition themselves. Their target is to sell 1 million EVs by 2030, which means they'll sell at most 1/10th the cars per year they do today. Their automotive branch will no longer exist or be just a ghost of their former self in 10-15 years.

They're losing none of their existing revenue by jumping on the streaming train.

Legacy automakers however *will* have to do that. Just look at Ford with their F-150 lightning. They're not making that because they wanna grow revenue or profit, but because they've realized that they're gonna go out of business if they don't pivot away from ICE vehicles and into EV's.

I can’t realistically see a primarily American manufacturer doing it, Tesla have stolen a march in america and the American manufacturers have been waning for years with their only real success at home.
The Japanese manufacturers are huge and their manufacturing expertise will start to tell - but im not sure they are convinced EV is the future, there are so many barriers to overcome that we’ve started to hit (lack of raw material) im not sure EVs can take off on a global scale.

What Tesla have done is phenomenal from a marketinf perspective, and battery perspective, but as cars they arent actually that great, and i expect quality to become more of an issue as they continue to scale.

I dont think long term Tesla will be able to maintain its growth in Europe and Japan as these manufacturers can and will rapidly expand their capacity.

7997,i7mqorx,t3_ujxfhb,"interest rates!  
this is a big reason why inflation is so consequential to financial assets

and in a u.s. stock market dominated by tech these days (long duration asset), the effects are felt to a greater extent.

why do rates matter so much? contrary to common opinion, it is not necessarily because of companies holding extensive debt, which is argued that would then need to be refinanced.   
in fact, a company may very well benefit from this inflationary environment if they hold fixed rate debt (inflation + higher rates will dramatically reduce this cost of capital); and should rates fall prior to such a company actually needing to refinance (not terribly unlikely imo) then they can theoretically reap the reward of our current rate/inflation environment without the pain on the backend.  


so why are long duration stocks getting crushed? because in investment valuation models (example: discounted free cash flow), you discount the future cash flows by the cost of capital, which is heavily influenced by interest rates! higher rates = higher discount rate = lower value of free cash flows. (check out the capm for those uninitiated)

this principle holds true for all stocks, bonds, etc. however, these growth stocks don't generate a lot of free cash flows, and are not poised to generate a lot of free cash flows in the near future (if ever). thus, those far distant free cash flows get penalized even more from that higher discount rate. (discounting 100$ of free cash flows one year from now is worth a whole lot more than discounting 100$ of free cash flows 10 years from now, especially when that discount rate increases)  


for the home builders, it is a bit more straight forward: higher mortgage rates will lead to home price appreciation to slow (possibly decline), which is a direct hit to their bottom line.",notjustjon,1651890163.0,1

\- High flyers - PYPL, NFLX, AMZN, DPZ - High P/E growth stocks.  These got hit by the double barreled shotgun of higher interest rates (which made their future earnings less valuable because they are discounted by a bigger factor) and the prospect of an economic slowdown which will suppress those earnings.  Who would pay 40x earnings for DPZ in that environment?

&#x200B;

\- Fallen tech angels - FB, you could also throw GOOGL in here.  The market thinks that users are moving to other platforms, and FB will become the next MySpace.  GOOGL is not as dependent on social, so they didn't get hit as hard.

&#x200B;

\- Home builders - IMHO, this is a knee-jerk reaction of higher rates -> less building -> home builders lose margin and struggle to pay debt.  I am going out on a limb and saying it is different this time, because (1) we still have a housing shortage from the underbuilding of the  2010s (2) builders balance sheets are in much better condition this cycle; many have little or no debt at all and (3) supply chain problems actually have a helpful effect because no competitors can ramp up production to try to take share, meaning supply will remain tight, and they should retain some pricing power.",asdf9988776655,1651906148.0,1

It is not like they have a bunch of if statements that can be shown to regulators. That sure would make things easy. You have to wonder if some of the regulators had computer classes a zillion years ago and are so out of touch that they think that is how it works in 2022?

This is an excellent paper if anyone is interested on the subject. It is from Google but it was for the entire industry use of machine learning models.

https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/

The other issue is that a big part of what Google invests into is counter people that try to game search. It is worth a huge amount of money if you can get your business to be returned higher on the organic search results.

There is an entire industry around it called SEO. Or Search Engine Optimization.

""Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because search is one of the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a website.""

Making too much public is going to make it a lot more difficult to counter and we will get sh*t search results.

The only people who benefit from generating negative pushback against this legislation are facebook, tiktok, youtube, and all the other platforms out there who are turning disgusting profits off of systems aiming to turn people into addicts in a really harmful way.

I don't think you understand how Bond Prices work. They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....

>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into

Yes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.

>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.

Uh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.

>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates

Inflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.

Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS

I already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle

The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

Which.... would be Consumer Staples....

>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.

Growth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.

TL;DR - Not going to respond to every point, but you're missing the mark completely.

8260,i5m78k7,t3_u8fb6r,"Not going to lie I didn’t read your post word for word but you seem to miss a key point.

Valuation is based on 2 key factors. 1: expected cash flows 2: WACC. This is the basis of any discounted cash flow model (yes I’m aware analysts will also use comp models, LBOs, etc. but they ALL use DCF and this is the basis for essentially every analysis)

1 - expected cash flows: you mentioned a few times that various companies have rising earnings and strengthening cash flows. While this is obviously good, the reason we are seeing the stock price fall now is because they were using these very strong growth precedents as the expectations. Analysts now have good reason to believe that won’t be the case any longer. So the DCF models are adjusted and valuations go down.

2 - WACC: the WACC or discount rate is made of 2 components. Cost of debt and cost of equity. Cost of debt is going up, I shouldn’t have to explain to you why. Cost of equity is a bit more complicated, but one of the factors here is the risk free rate of return. Given that T bills are rising in return, that component is increased. Another factor is risk. As the risk of companies increases so does the cost of equity because investors want a discount for more risk. Given that tech stocks did not previously have a significant discount, this means we can assume investors expected high returns. Now that high returns are less likely, investors have increased their discount requirements.

These two factors combine give our equation a smaller numerator and a larger denominator, and thus a much smaller final valuation. For these stocks to now be discounted you have to believe that cash flows will not substantially decrease, but that they will also increase enough to overcome the larger cost and risk.

TLDR: stocks declined because EXPECTATIONS (not performance) declined, and the cost/risk increased. Expectations were previously very high (due to historical performance, which is no longer expected) and cost was very low.",Explosive_Banana6969,1650548983.0,2

8575,iak4bwv,t3_v0zuvq,"Rant ahead: I think it's a mistake to lump semiconductors in with ""tech"" generally. 

Their product goes *in* technology, but at the core it's still a commodity. 

If you own a SaaS business like Adobe, or a platform like FB, or a payments network like MA: you have some fixed costs to run the thing, pay your software engineers, and so on. But, your value proposition will be unique, you collect ongoing revenue as people use your service/platform, and the marginal cost per added customer is very low. The result can be very high, stable profit margins and lots of cash to reward investors.

Semiconductors are not that. They have large fixed costs and capital expenditures to stay on the cutting edge of chip development. Then, the chips they make become indistinct inputs into durable goods and the only real edge is ""ours is faster and smaller"" so they're constantly consuming more more more R&D spend to not fall behind.

8673,haoca8z,t3_pd70od,"The big difference is that YouTube has not been fully monetized.   So it creates a better runway than what Netflix has.

YouTube value has yet to be priced into Google.

One big one yet to happen is the ending of ad blockers.   Take YouTube TV.  You can't block ads because the ads are put in the stream instead of out of stream.  It is only a matter of time until Google puts the ads in stream with YouTube and making the ad blockers no longer function.

I would guess they will do it gradually.  But it will come.  The ads out of stream is not necessary with YouTube as Google owns 100% of YouTube.  Usually the ads are handled out of stream for privacy reasons.  That way Google does the ad without leaking any data to the company that requested the ad.

You really want to own all five.  GOOG/GOOGL, AMZN, AAPL, FB and MSFT.  But out of the five I really like Google easily the best.  They just have a ton more runway to work with compared to the others.  Runway built on assets yet to be fully monetized.  YouTube is a perfect example.    

It is also why Google has been the best performing in 2021 of the five and that should continue for the foreseeable future.    Compare to Apple for example.  In 2021 Google is up over 65% and AAPL about 15%.  So 4x better return with Google and I would expect that to continue for at least the next couple of years.",bartturner,1630154329.0,15

But this will only continue on for a couple years.

Overall, Netflix is like AOL during the dot-com bubble. Not innovative enough.


As for them trying gaming: this is exactly what I mean. This is not innovation, this is desperation. Gamers and TV watchers are two totally different target groups. One is active entertainment one is passive entertainment. 

They are doing this to tap into a new market since they themselves know they hit a ceiling, but they don't know anything about this market or have any credibility there.

The problem with Netflix is that the Witcher, Castlevania and the Dota series were hugely successful but after the series ended all those viewers where so hyped from the shows they went to play the video games associated with those shows rather than stay on netflix. In particular the [Witcher 3 showed a big spike in players after the Netflix show](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/the-witcher-3-sales-were-up-554-thanks-to-the-netflix-show/).

Publicly Netflix have said their competition isn't streaming sites like hulu or disney but [Videogames like Fortnight](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2019/01/17/netflix-reveals-that-its-biggest-threat-is-fortnite/?sh=adf585c37638). 

I think that overall Netflix has been successful with their shows using gaming IP. Valve and CD Projeck Red seem happy. I got no idea how they capture the gaming audience because they seem to binge on the content then leave. 

I'm sure Microsoft would love to have a really successful Halo show that boosts the audience but I don't think they would be happy if those viewers were stuck on the Netflix platform rather than on the Xbox platform.

Netflix big problem is retaining their viewers; I can't see how they solve that problem with gaming unless they somehow do a partnership with Sony for a hybrid streaming platform which sounds crazy.

I would not be buying Roku. At all. I would be shorting the shit out of it. To understand why let me provide some background

History

Roku started out with dongles around 10 years ago. This was a super cool since it turned any dumb TV into a Smart TV. This got people talking. Roku grew in popularity and gained significant market share while spending fuck all on marketing. From their 2018 10k

    “The Company incurred advertising costs of $3.4 million, $3.9 million and $4.1 million for the years December 31, 2017, 2016 and December 26, 2015 respectively.”

Roku gained market share by being in the right place at the right time and not having to worry about the big boys playing in their space. Once the dongle phase died out and all TVs were smart, Roku needed to be embedded in an OEM. Roku partnered with TCL (at the time a random Chinese company with no brand equity). Roku needed TCLs hardware capabilities and TCL needed Rokus goodwill with Americans and retail distribution channels.

With the absence of any serious threat, they switched from selling dongles to partnering with TCL and selling ad space on their OS. This drove up their ARPU to something absurd. From ~$10 in 2016 to $40+ today. Sounds amazing right? The problem is this caught the eyes of Google and Amazon.

#1 Why Roku is boned - The landscape

As people moved away from linear TV, so active users and so did the advertising $$$. This caught the attention of the big boys – AMZN & GOOG. More active users means more $$$ and the big boys want a slice of that pie. But it’s not all about $$$, the TV OS space just happens to play into both of their broader strategies around smart home integration and controlling the living room. Because of these $$$ on the table and the alignment to broader strategy, AMZN and GOOG decided going HARD in this space. Both of them have now established partnerships with huge OEMs like Google – Sony, leaving Roku limited OEMs to partner with and still limited to the low end of the market. This has begun to slow down their growth and they have, for the first time, began loosing market share in the US But why can’t Roku just partner with Samsung or LG who are the top players in mid to high end? Because TV OSes now generate fuck you $$. Samsung and LG already missed the boat with mobile. They are not willing to cede all that sweet sweet advertising $$$. Not only is Roku up against Google and Amazon, who have deep pockets and have just started to take this space seriously ( see Android TV’s rebrand to Google), you are up against the best TV manufactures in the world (LG and Samsung)

# 2 Why Roku is boned – Active users is slowing and no room to grow

AU is capping out in the US. There are very few dumb TV’s left to convert to smart TV’s and those purchasing smart TV’s have a huge range of different OS’s to choose from at all levels. So how is Roku going to get more users? Why not just go to Europe or Asia? The problem is, Roku has been saying that for years. Let’s take a look at their historical 10Ks Year ending 2017 “Further, we believe international expansion represents a large opportunity to grow our active accounts. We plan to continue to invest in our international strategy over time and become a global business in the long term.”

Roku has been saying this every year for the last 5 years. However they have completely failed internationally. They have <5% market share internationally and have lost everything to Amazon and Google and the Koreans.

    “While Roku captured a significant share of global viewing time, this prominence was primarily driven by North America, where it commanded 37% of big-screen viewing time in Q1 2021,” Conviva’s report stated. “In the second largest market for Roku, Europe, the company only accounted for 8% share of the big screen, trailing a number of other devices, including Samsung with 19%, Chromecast with 12%, Amazon Fire TV with 10%, LG TV with 10%, and Android TV with 9%.

    ""Roku’s position is even worse in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South Africa, all of which it has 4% usage or less, Conviva added. “ Given that Roku can’t reproduce it’s stick growth strategy that led to its massive growth early on. Do you really think that Roku can take back market share from Google, Amazon & Samsung in global markets? Absolutely not

Once active users declines (which is only a matter of time given the aggression from everyone else), ad spend will follow and Roku’s growth trajectory is done

Roku has made a last ditch attempt at for survival with it's latest campaign ""OK, Roku does that"". This is it's first every campaign and drove up advertising costs 4x.

# 3 Why Roku is boned – Producing content is expensive

Roku took a huge fuck you bet on the Roku Channel to drive up ARPU. More viewing time means more $$. The problem is, content is fucking expensive. Just look how much Netflix has blown on content to produce (at best) completely mediocre shows. You can argue that the Roku TV is free so people aren’t paying for it. The problem with that is, at some point Netflix, Hulu, other streaming giants are going to have to offer an ad supported tier to keep their valuations up. Once Netflix does that, are people really going to watch free shit produced by Roku when they can watch free shit produced by Disney or Netflix (or any other of the 100 other services? Absolutely not. Roku is going to spend billions in a market to get boned by Netflix or Disney

Conclusion

Roku is fucked. Yes its history has been impressive but now it’s stuck between Tech Giants, Hardware Giants, and Streaming Giants who all want a piece of advertising $$$. I don’t see how Roku can compete since it’s missed the boat on international expansion and starting way behind on original content. The only hope for Roku is to get bought out by Apple (who also has done terribly in the TV OS space) but also wants a slice of that pie. Apple has the money and Roku will be desperate in 1-2 years from now.",10gem_elprimo,1650937641.0,2

If that is your takeaway, then the problem isn't the market: it's your understanding of the market.

There are *plenty* of companies who have relatively little growth, and their price does not crater and they are perceived to have value to investors.  Typically these companies have pretty steady earnings and pay out dividends, and investors value those dividends.

The issue with Netflix is that so much of their stock price was from the *expected future growth*, and the high PE indicates that the growth was expected to be fairly rapid or sustained.  So when they announced that subs dropped and were expected to drop again when previously they were expected to pick up a couple of million each quarter, then that means the growth that was priced in likely is not coming, and so it is 100% rational and expected that the price of the stock would drop sharply.",ptwonline,1650836495.0,1

Netflix raises rates every couple years, very normal.  Their revenue growth rate is also pretty linear with only a slightly rising curve.  Q4 2021 was the highest revenue it's ever had.  Q1 2022 is again the highest revenue it's ever had.  Even so, three stock tanked.

So, all we can blame is expense.

Well, expense is the one thing they have full control over, so any profit/loss changes are entirely deliberate acts.  And we know these acts have not been bad because subscription growth had remains solid.

INTC rocketed in the dotcom boom with its share price increasing from \~$20 to a height of $75. Once the dotcom bubble burst, it's share price dropped to \~$40, almost 50% off highs. From there, it proceeded to drop to $30, staying in that range for a few months, before dropping to $20, almost 75% off highs.

If you had bought the stock at this point, you would have seen it grow again to $35 a share in a few months (not bad) before it plunged to new lows of $13-14 a share. Buying at that point, you would have ridden the stock back up to $35, before it dropped yet again. For the next few years INTC would go up and down, but in a downward trend, until it finally bottomed at \~$12 a share in the 2009 financial crisis, almost \*a full decade\* after the dotcom bubble burst.

Today, INTC trades at $45 a share, not far off from its price after the initial dotcom burst. Think about the opportunity cost of holding a stock like INTC through the decades.

A few things to take away:

Is INTC a cherrypicked example? Absolutely. Other stocks rebounded extraordinarily well from the dotcom crash, like AMZN, GOOG. How confident are you that the stocks you're considering are the next AMZN and GOOG and not the next INTC? What features of the stock or the company led to your conclusion? Have you done the research you need to do to make an intelligent hypothesis?

Was INTC untradable? Absolutely not. If you had bought the stock at $13 a share, you could have sold at $35 a little more than a year later. That's a stellar return. But do you have a system that will let you capture these types of moves and avoid riding the roller coaster back down? Do you have a price target grounded in reality? And a plan for what to do if the stock never reaches your price target? Do you have rules for when you sell a stock?",Ldubble,1645208860.0,65

Before COVID there are lot of guessing that by 2026, 2030, there will be XX revenue/profit. However, COVID environments fast-forward their growth story and expose their actual potential. A lot of projections have become reality, which would give you great numbers, but also kill the imagination.

Like Zoom, Docusign, Roku, Redfin, Fulgent, Moderna, Teledoc, Shopify, Vroom, Fiverr, etc. The COVID allows investors to see their future 5-10 years early. Of course there will be great growth, but like options, you lose the time value provided by uncertainty. Accelerated growth, but also accelerated depletion of growth potential.

Even for large companies like Paypal, Meta, Netflix, Disney, there is a growth sector in it that would be affected by the mechanism above in the same way.

Some of these companies came out strong - Zoom, Moderna, Fulgent, etc. (compared to 2019, not the high), but most of them did not. When people see fast forwarded future, they are not the company projected, they would devest.

Many of these companies still have great top and bottom line financial reports, but it is often the future guideline that kills the price. This is like buying OTM call options - when price move up but not fast enough, the options price would plummet. You don't ask ""the stock price went up why the option is cheaper"", because the time value depleted.

Were\* and yes many people were making that argument pre-COVID. Even if we may be overcorrecting (and there's an argument there I guess but it's probably not that binary), most of these selloffs are the effect of finally being able to see the downside in companies in a market that ignored them for almost a decade. For example, historically, profit mattered, and then it largely didn't for the majority of the bull market run. Anything that was an interesting idea could ride the wave even if the logistics weren't as worked out as they should be.

I can't stream movies,  I download games for my kid on Steam at 7 KBTS per sec, yep, that's right,  slower than dial up i had in the 90s from the AOL disks.

So far, based on everything I've read on the Starlink sub they are under-promissing what they are doing.  People are reporting much higher speeds than advertised. 

When Starlink is available there are a lot of rural people in the US, and other countries who haven't had the opportunity to get any streaming service before.   After that happens,  you should see a ""surprise "" jump in subscriptions to all the streaming services,  since Netflix is the largest,  most well known,  it should benefit the most.  

Delays in Starlink availability might push this to the fourth quarter,  I think that's unlikely since they successfully launched four rockets last month and one so far this month and have almost filled the first shell of phase one.  Just need some time (up to three months) for the satellites to get in position.   Other possible risk is dish production and delivery delays.

9185,gv9xp5g,t3_mv2e02,"Years ago I prescribed a way for Netflix to avoid this.  Netflix's problem(s) at the time were multiple.  One was the cumulative loss of the kind of content that kept people contendedly hooked.  Loss of Disney, loss of Marvel, loss of Friends, loss of The Office, etc.  Another was their profligate spending without discriminating for quality or effectiveness of the spend.  There's others, but these two are a good place to focus.

What's crazy is a solution and chance to thrive is obvious, and I've been pitching it for a long time.

Netflix should have rushed to offer an open door and platform to content creators, then take a chunk of their wonton spending and repurpose it to variable reward payments to those creators based on popularity and potential, as measured by Netflix's strong business intelligence systems.  

They have/had all the difficult parts of that already.  Money to pay creators, sophisticated digital popularity tracking, and the mother of all distribution.  

It solves their biggest failings: lack of content, lack of ongoing freshness, lack of knowing what content to buy, lack of knowing what to pay for given content.

It would gave turned Netflix into a sort of cross between YouTube and American Idol and OnlhFans, where the ""best"" content gets rewarded, and where fans of artists can make the platform succeeded by supporting their favort creators.  

The low end of the content would be mostly unwatched, but it wouldn't cost them anything.  The highest end of the content would drive hype and engagement.  But they'd only be paying big bucks for the content that is proven successful.  Any studio (which is what Netflix has been aspiring to be) would kill for the chance to *only* pay top dollar for top content, and to avoid ever paying for a single flop.

As they're running it now, Netflix dumps tens of billions into content and closes their eyes and hopes some fraction of it is deemed ok.  That's incredibly inefficient.  

Let all the aspiring future Tarantinos put their pilot on Netflix.  The ones that rise will be rewarded, the ones that don't will still count as content and might help maintain niche viewer groups.  The model would be geared to favor continuous releases, be it nightly reports or weekly releases.  It would keep fans subscribed permanently, instead of conditioned for the wasteful whole season pump-and-drop weekends, where they don't get the bang for their content buck.",Summebride,1618969048.0,7

And we're now setting up for possibly/likely Disney's best park season ever.  Everything is going to be up - attendance, prices, total spend.

But with all that being said - knee jerk reaction on any streaming bad news could also pull down (or hold back) the entire stock.  

But in my opinion that's just a better buying price for those willing to hold another quarter.

Problem with shorting is you don't know when it's gonna fall. it's not like going long, where you can just wait forever for it to go up. Short is essentially a time-limited leveraged investment because you need to borrow that stock and short it by a certain time. And I'm pretty sure retail investors can't naked short. On top of that you are exposed to infinite risk, because the price can go up to infinity. 

If you think the price will fall, you can buy put options. But even then you still need to know when and how far you think the price will fall. However your risk is limited to 100% of the price + option premium.",polynomials,1623727335.0,1

9619,h1tisbx,t3_o00pa3,"I dont own any NFLX

Here is my opinion. Its probably time to put to rest the idea that any platform will dominate. It wont. I think we need to start talking about them like they are ""tv channels"" not like ""cable providers.""

Think back to the days when we had only 10-20 channels on tv. Later, we had 200-300. Did the new channels hurt the old ones? The answer is, not really. What hurt them was their own programming, not someone elses.

The other providers wont slow them because none of them will provide enough new content on their own to keep people satisfied regardless. I mean seriously... even if Netflix suddenly had 10 big hit shows, that barely 120-200 hours a year of content. Pretty sure people spend more than 2-4 hours a week on tv... they will need more than 1 content provider and who has 10 shows worth watching? LoL.

So forget competition.

Does Netflix have enough exclusive content to hold and gain new customers at $9-$14/mo? I would say yes. For me its Witcher, Umbrella Academy and Stranger Things.

Is their stock priced high? Well I dont own any for a reason...

yea I think its a bit too high because I am not really sure how many more subs hey can actually get. So given their high PE, I dont want to be stuck with a company that may very well hit their cap in a 2-3 years. The PE will likely still be 30 or so on current basis so to me, thats not so great. They will need to start raising prices to keep the rev growth going up which is fine but it will likely decay to 15 PE pretty quickly from there. Pass for now. Id rather hold Amazon because they have more avenues of growth as crazy as that sounds. Then again, maybe sub growth will be much higher than that. Maybe they can get into China or maybe India skyrockets. Dunno. They might have capped the USA and other English speaking nations but no idea about the others.",thejumpingsheep2,1623736481.0,1

9626,h1tq9yl,t3_o00pa3,"Netflix has significant advantages in software, international growth and support, and custom content. While other companies have been sleeping and sticking to old models, Netflix steadily grew its own content farm and became a big player in custom content, paying new and buzzing creators big payouts and building a reputation of creative freedom and quality similar to what HBO and AMC networks were able to build. In addition, Netflix has really found out the international game, creating quality custom content for other countries. The custom new content will only grow, with hits such as Stranger Things, Queen's Gambit, Tiger King, and Bridgerton. 

Netflix also has superior data tracking, allowing them to find out exactly what you like and gear content creation where the audience is better than any competition other than maybe Disney. Disney is limited by its brand however, and can't stray too far from the Disney principles, similar to how Nintendo can't stray too far from their style of content.   


Netflix is still the leader with over 200 million subscribers, Disney with over 100 million and HBO and Huly with only about 40 million. Other services straggle with far less than 40 million subscribers. Killer content like The Office isn't enough to combat this. By being an early player, with superior tech, Netflix is poised to be a market leader for years to come. In addition, other companies will find the costs of getting into the battle too high and they may fold. In order to compete with the established players, they have to offer a competing price point, which means they have a higher price for content per subscriber.   


I believe Netflix will continue to be able to produce content that can capture audiences, while the other companies to compete will have deep pockets like Amazon, Disney and Apple, and we may see some companies give up and realize licensing their content is the way to go to be profitable, instead of having to get into the business of technology which is an expensive business to run. Also, it's been shown that users have a higher threshold of acceptance for being subscribed to multiple services. Most people will probably have a combination of Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney and find this totally acceptable. I feel that shorting Netflix would be a foolish thing to do, as they are still in a long term trend of adding subscribers and while the trend is slowing, they show no signs of declining, even with competition.

Their deliberately opaque subscriber metrics.  Loss of crucially attractive content.  Their crazily irresponsible studio operation.  Their (probable) saturation in certain markets.  Their lack of ability to compete in the content spending arms race that they caused.  That they won't reveal how many subs are paying $15 and how many are paying $2.  The fact their many competitors (Apple, Disney, Facebook, Amazon, Google) can afford to burn money for decades longer than Netflix can.

I just don't see how they can continue to grow at a rate good enough to justify their high valuation especially now that everybody is pulling their content from Netflix and creating their own streaming service to compete against Netflix.

Thankfully, I never tried to short Netflix though because if I would have, I would have started before the unexpected pandemic gave Netflix a boost and therefore that short would not have gone well for me.

Netflix also has powerful brand loyalty that is not logical. I've talked to so many people that just continue to mindlessly pay their Netflix subscription every month even when they don't have any new content to watch. And then I hear these people talk about how they would love to watch some other show but can't because it is not on Netflix so I suggest: ""Why don't you just cancel Netflix for a while and subscribe to the other streaming service that has the show that you really want to watch and then cancel that one after you are finished with their content and come back to Netflix once Netflix has more new content that you want to watch?"" and they then look at me like I'm speaking gibberish.

That kind of brand loyalty will take a while to break, so while I do think that the days of high growth for Netflix will be coming to an end and I still believe that Netflix stock will eventually start to go significantly downward, it is impossible to predict exactly how long that will take to happen so I would never short it.

n
Not true. There are still companies that will license out content to whoever bids on them and don't have a streaming service. Even the companies that have streaming services will still license out content to Netflix. In fact, they will still even make shows for Netflix. In TV there's a a long history of companies making shows for other channels they don't own and that probably won't change any time soon. 

Amazon has a lot of cash, but it doesn't mean that they are going to consistently spend it all on Amazon Prime video. They have other endeavors too and companies like to hold on to cash. 


> And now that everyone has a streaming service, Netflix is losing a lot of their shows it feels. They've lost their most popular one to Peacock, and their own originals don't seem to be blowing up consistently like they did in the Stranger Things era when they had The Office along with many other shows.

Netflix is losing a lot of old shows that are popular but thy also replace them with other llicensed popular shows. But on top of that they are making lots of new shows. Netflix shows do not to blow up like stranger things in order to bring values to consumers. Netflix doesn't make more money by having the most watched shows. They make money by continuing to add value that people stay subscribed. And Netflix still makes popular content that trends or gets critical acclaim at least every months. But again that doesn't matter as long as you have people watching something. Whether it's all one show or spread across multiple shows; what matters is that they are subscribed.


One last thing to note is that streaming isn't a zero sum game. Amazon, Disney, etc. growiing doesn't mean Netflix has to blow up.",ijakinov,1623778589.0,1

They lack a moat. So many tech giants are eating up their market share. There was much apocalyptic forecasting about how everyone would have 5+ subscriptions and we would have ""television channels"" on the internet (some time in the last decade). The truth is that most people cancel subscriptions in good times and bad when they are highly overlapping. The other fact is that the more people observe shows and movies online the more people experiment with getting content from sources they don't even need to pay for. NFLX is dying slowly and at best you can expect them to be absorbed by another content provider and they will continue creating original and lower budget shows as a subsidiary.

Let's not forget one thing. They tried to be political and force the American vision of gender pronouns and make it appear as if 1/3 people are somewhere in the LGBT rainbow. Most of the world is nowhere near our average American of indifference and very few places outside of the west even tolerate such openness and plurality of sexual choices and identities. 


Do not mix business and politics. Even when you're powerful/wealthy enough to buy out governments and legal structures... the end game is not good and there is often blowback.

I just wonder how accurate their predictions are about what will happen when they stop password sharing.  I think there will be a lot of people who just don't pay for it (even the ""main"" account folks).  I suspect there are quite a few parents who pay for Netflix and share the password with their adult children.  The adult children actually don't watch it much, and the password thing will cause everyone to talk about it and realize they don't need Netflix.  


The actual shows and movies on Netflix have gotten thin.  Almost nothing I want to watch is on there.  We have small kids, and we would never get rid of Disney+.  We will not pay for Netflix if we suddenly can't borrow a password.

9819,i8zsgzx,t3_urowhk,"netflix's biggest problem is that they got overvalued when they had the streaming market monopolized, and now that they have competition they can't really compete.

their prices keep going up, but they're miles behind everyone else in terms of ad supported tiers. more importantly, their first party shows are terrible when compared to the competition. they basically fall into the categories of ""unintended comedies"" and ""memes"".

pachter's restaurant comparison misses some key comparisons. the high end restaurants he mention offer superior quality but at a much higher price, at far fewer locations, with  much more restrictive hours, and aren't a quick option. with streaming, netflix isn't cheaper than the competing services (in fact, it's more expensive). it isn't more accessible or more convenient, it doesn't have any of the stuff going for it that fast food chains do when they find a way to compete with the high end sit down places.

Like, I think Apple is overvalued right now at a PE of 26, but even I don't think Apple is going to crash 80% from ATH.  At ATH, its PE was 32.  Historical PE floor is 10.  So even with that extreme multiple compression, current EPS puts the floor at 61.5, which would be a 66% drop based on nothing but sentiment.

To get to -80% (36.49), you have to get a 66% multiple drop and a 40% earnings drop.  That would take an utter catastrophe that quite frankly...look...even as a bear myself, you just can't predict that kind of catastrophe, so there's no point in even considering it or trying to plan for it, because you'll be paralyzed by fear *always*, because there's *always* the possibility that everything will blow up in your face.

A reasonable expectation would be another 10-25% down from here in the broad market, varying by the type of company or industry.  You can't point to anything fundamental or statistical to justify a fear of anything greater than that.  To be sure--it could still happen, absolutely.  But you cannot be *reasonably* fearful of that, in my opinion.

As an aside: Netflix is a different story.  Anyone with half a lick of sense could reasonably say that its continued expansion was implausible, due to a huge number of competitors in the media space, and that a PE of 60 was way too much. That was a perfectly reasonable position to take, and look, it panned out.  But Netflix hasn't crashed due to the market going tits-up--it's crashed because a lot of folks came to their senses and started valuing it as what it is: a media company.  And lo and behold, its PE is now in line with other media companies, and there *will* be a valuation floor for it as long as it continues to make money.",HeyYoChill,1652027677.0,39

AMD’s most recent CPUs and GPUs are on par or exceeding competition. In addition, they haven’t even released their next gen CPUs, which Intel JUST did. Of course the gap should be closer.

But what really lost me was when you pulled out the PE ratio. Why invest in a **growth** stock that’s not even growing? Intel released earnings, states that they’re looking at rough quarters ahead and growth will slow. Then AMD releases earnings, blows out projections, gains 70% y/y, and increases projections for the rest of the year.

And you’re saying buy Intel? Really? The company that is struggling to gain?

9907,i7tzqeq,t3_ul3wo8,"> Mortgage rates.

> US mortgage rates were around 2.5% for 30 years merely 4 months ago.

> Recently they've been over 6%. If you assume most people 'buy as much house as they can afford for a monthly payment', then that equates to every $500k house becoming a $400k house, even absent a recession or any other factors like change of housebuyer sentiment in the market. It seems to me a lot of people haven't figured this out.

For what it's worth, most also don't account for the fact that mortgage interest is deductible, as is property tax, and while the standard deduction doubled a few years back, when you start talking about $500k homes, you are likely to be over that standard deduction with both prop taxes and mortgage interest combined... So considering the tax breaks, it's not quite as stark as a $500k budget going to $400k since some of the extra cost comes out of your paycheck pre-tax.

.... Also, more than 1/3rd of homes don't even carry a mortgage, they are owned outright, and the average equity is more than 50%. So, rising rates really only hurts first time buyers without much assets, existing owners can trade homes all day long.

> Nah it won't happen

>Now you will all have lots of reasons why 'that can't happen again, this time is different' etc. Copium is a real psychological effect, read up on 'the five stages of grief bargaining' etc. But load up the share price charts for your favourite memes and scroll back to 2015-2016.

This seems like a non-sequitur. You can't just that people pointing out differences between now and the past are huffing copium without evidence.

I don't think bear markets or recessions are a thing of the past, but **the elephant in the room is we haven't had a serious bear market since the Fed decided to use QE and rates to prevent crises**. It's kind of hard to predict how the market will react going forward when it seems like the Fed will simply start easing/buying assets and lowering the overnight rate when it needs to.

Granted, their mandates are inflation and unemployment, not directly the equity market prices, however I would say personally that I think maintaining steadily low unemployment and smooth inflation will lead to fewer sharp recessions or drawdowns.

9976,g617vr4,t3_ivrimz,"""Eleven-year-old Amy starts to rebel against her conservative family’s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew.""

That is what the official trailer on YouTube has in the description.  Nothing about a ""critique of culture sexualising young girls."" That description has yet to be changed.

 ""Director Maïmouna Doucouré on September 4 reacted to this international controversy in a *Time* interview, saying that her film had been misinterpreted. ""For me, this film is sounding an alarm,"" the director told the magazine. ""This film tries to show that our children should have the time to be children, and we as adults should protect their innocence and keep them innocent as long as possible."" From Newsweek

Ok, nice message but... the girls in this movie were sexualised and rewarded by getting the part.  Ok ok, but ""it was like 5 minutes of the film."" How many minutes before you draw the line, would 10 minutes of these scenes be too much?  15? 20?  I say 1 minute is too much.  

""Watching the rest of the film though, even scenes where the girls are performing suggestive dance moves, the whole point is to demonstrate that they're simply doing what they see in the world around them. "" From Newsweek

And what they, and apparently 650 little girls were asked to do to get a part in the movie. 

""The scenes that have been deemed inappropriate are the very ones commentating on the issues the film is about. You shouldn't watch the scenes thinking they're sexual, but rather recognize that the girls are imitating a highly sexualized culture they've found on the internet."" From Newsweek 

I have no doubt that was the intention, I deal with the same issue with my nieces that I am guardian for.  I would not have allowed them to join in with 650 other girls to audition for these parts. And that is my issue, and the issue for most people, that they brought in 650 little girls to compete for these roles, feeding this gross media culture. 

""*Cuties* director Maïmouna Doucouré has indeed spoken about some of the sexualization that she witnessed that inspired the film. In an interview with [Screen Daily,](https://www.screendaily.com/features/director-maimouna-doucoure-reveals-the-shocking-inspiration-behind-sundance-drama-cuties/5146481.article) the director explained that the inspiration came from seeing young girls perform in a sexually suggestive fashion. ""They danced in a very sexually suggestive manner. There also happened to be a number of African mothers in the audience. I was transfixed, watching with a mixture of shock and admiration. I asked myself if these young girls understood what they were doing,"" she said. "" From Newsweek

So she asks 650 little girls to compete for these parts, while turning around and then criticizing it. Did she ask herself if those girls understood what they were doing in the auditions?  In her film? 

I cancelled Netflix not because I thought Doucouré was trying to slip cp past everybody, but because she holds up her (valid) critique on the sexualization of women while standing on the backs of the 650 little girls that likely watched and learned how to dance like this in competition for a spot in her movie.

It's not because of Cuties specifically (though this is extremely fucked up), more so that Netflix just doesn't have good content anymore, which is probably why they're producing garbage like this to draw attention. Their TV shows are all shit I've either already seen (honestly how many times can I rewatch The Office?) or have no interest in. Even their well-reviewed Originals are mediocre IMO, or they have one good season and then fall off hard.

Their movie lineup constantly changes, and if I really want to watch something that's only on Netflix I can always rent it from Amazon or iTunes. I've enjoyed a few of their original movies but they're forgettable.",dumbledorky,1600539819.0,4

Netflix is the king of derivative forgettable content.   Nobody churns it out it better.  That's what cable used to be full of, but everyone still subscribed, and now Netflix carries that torch.

The price has inched upward over time and is now almost as expensive as HBO.  But people need a *reason* to subscribe to HBO.  HBO has to earn each subscriber with a critically acclaimed unique work of art they can't miss.

Netflix is the opposite.  The default is to keep it because sure, the last three things you watched sucked and you haven't even used it in two months but maybe you will soon.  People need a reason to *cancel* Netflix.

It's kinda funny to see people talking about valuations here while seemingly ignoring the fact that companies like TSM, QCOM, AMAT, AMD, and NVDA have literally grown their revenues by over 30% in the last year while improving margins.  AMD alone grew 68% (not including XLNX).  

QCOM (who grew revenue by 30%) sees automotive as moving from a 1B market to a 10B market by the end of the decade.  They are also trading at a forward PE less than 15 with strong FCF.  

TSMC's CEO in the last earnings call called out that what's different today is amount of silicon content per 'device'.  Even if we sell just as many PCs/phones next year as the last... there are more chips and more expensive chips in each device.  We are also starting up a 5G CapEx cycle.

The bigger deal is going to be how the world handles mass adoption of EVs and chargers.  The typical EV has 4x the amount of silicon content per car than the typical ICE car and as more enter the ecosystem there will be increased computing needs to improve the intelligence of the electrical grid.

The main issue is wafer supply and to increase wafer supply, OEMs have to build new fabs. These fabs can take 3-5 years to reach full production and most OEMs only pledged to build new fabs in 2021, which means true relief would come at the soonest in ~2024. 

Demand for consumer electronics are at all times highs, despite covid. Looking at the rise of the EV sector, the number of chips in an EV is 2-3X that of ICEs. 

Following the 08-09 semiconductor shortage, many OEMs over anticipated demand because customers were overcharging their “demand”. When true demand eventually dropped 20-30%, the chip suppliers were left bag holding inventory. Flash forward to present day, semiconductor demand is at another all time high. Chip OEMs are having trouble determining whether their order backlog is overcharged or true backlog from the increased demand of consumer electronics/EVs. Chip suppliers will likely be fearful of bag holding and error on the side of caution so as to not oversupply the market.

That means the one thing Netflix can (and MUST!) do is get their drunken studio under control.  They need to flip from being the worst run studio in the business to the best.  Yes, that's a tall order, but it's mandatory if they expect to control their own destiny. 

Otherwise they can bleed for awhile and keep hahazardly approving and cancelling content, while radically overpaying.  But they will eventually run out of magic dust.  

One way is to use an onlyfans model where they provide an amazing platform for content providers, and pay the most successful content makers handsomely.

I already do this and it is so much cheaper to just buy the stuff that I'm interested in one time rather than continually paying multiple streaming services. If I went the streaming route, I would have to subscribe to at least 5 different streaming services to get just about half of my favorites and that still wouldn't even give me access to the other half of my favorites.

I imagine it is a similar situation for most people so will it ever get to the point where most people have had enough of their favorite content being spread across too many different services and realize that it would be cheaper to just buy the content that really interests them and not have to worry about what service is their favorite content on this month anymore?",StarWolf478,1617916850.0,5

>SHOP down 80%?

All the randos that started their new shitty online store in the last 2 years only to realize there's a million shitty online stores and no one wants their shit are giving up. Stock was priced based on ridiculous unsustainable growth.

&#x200B;

>Fb over 50%?

Proving themselves to be the Blockbuster of ads. iOS 14 killed their platform and rather than preparing for that ahead of time, they let themselves get steamrolled and it's nearly impossible for advertisers to make money on there now.

&#x200B;

>PayPal 75%?

Suffering the same fate as INTC - competition is rising, they charge a premium vs. their competitors, they're not really innovating enough to justify that they'll not continue to cede activity to competitors. Not just SQ either but it's become ridiculously expensive to send money overseas on PayPal and services like Wise popped up and are considerably less expensive to do that on. That and Ebay decoupled from them which probably hurt.

&#x200B;

>Amzn?

My guess is people spending less online as they get back into the real world plus small businesses probably spending less on cloud due to getting reamed by pandemic. They were valued pretty high PE for a big corp and they're coming back into more normal PE valuations.

&#x200B;

>Netflix?

They continued to spend an arm and a leg on original content and still couldn't avoid losing subscribers in their bread and butter markets due to competitors. Netflix competitors are to Netflix what Netflix was to cable companies.

&#x200B;

>Every single stock Cathie wood owns? (except Tesla)

To be fair, unless she suddenly went over to blue chips, with how non-blue-chip tech has been faring, it would've been hard not to lose 2/3 in 6 months, but that still looks pretty bad.

FB, PYPL, AMZN .. yes they had a bad quarter and meh outlook, but I don't see that be the reason for down 80%.  This is just insane.

But the  key reason for this insanity is inflation.  Inflation is high and everyone wants to see it come down.  But the story may not be over there.  Earlier fed was accommodative.  Given this inflation rout, do you think fed will be dovish at all in next few years ?  I don't think so.  The only reason for them to be dovish is if the unemployment is sky high.  And the situation right now is exactly the opposite.  Unemployment is very low.

So they are not going to be dovish at all.  It would be wrong for them to do so.

Netflix is in a tough position with so much competition.   Which also then increases the cost of acquiring content.

Deutsche Bank Sees 5%-6% Fed Target Rate and Deep U.S. Recession
A significant recession by next year seems likely, it says
U.S. unemployment may rise several points, economists project

The Federal Reserve is likely to need to engage in the most aggressive monetary tightening since the 1980s to tamp down an inflation rate at a four-decade high, which will lead to a deep U.S. recession next year, Deutsche Bank AG economists warned.
“We assume conservatively that a Fed funds rate moving well into the 5% to 6% range will be sufficient to do the job this time,” the authors including David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist and head of research, wrote in a report Tuesday. “This is partly because the monetary-tightening process will be bolstered by Fed balance-sheet reduction, which our U.S. economics team estimates will be equivalent to a couple additional 25 basis-point rate hikes.”
This monetary tightening and the financial upheaval that accompanies it “will push the economy into a significant recession by late next year,” Folkerts-Landau said, adding Deutsche sees the unemployment ultimately rising “several percentage points.”
The Deutsche economists -- by their own admission -- are much more pessimistic than most other major forecasters. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics’ recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it’ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.
In the Deutsche economists’ view, the FOMC’s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won’t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That’s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. 
Deutsche estimated a neutral rate that’s much higher than the Fed’s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.",State_Dear,1651132121.0,1

10397,gmkeyqm,t3_lf15za,"To answer your questions:

**Would it be a good idea to invest before this happens(if it does)?**

Yes, mergers or buy-outs will (nearly) always make the stock of the weaker company increase in value.

**Or would AMC stock forfeit?**

No, if a company is bought and gets consumed by the buyer i.e. AMC ceases to exist and becomes 'Netflix Cinema', they will have an agreement in place to value each share at a certain amount. So, if AMC is trading at say $7 a share, Netflix might offer $8 a share. As such the shareholder has each unit of stock converted to $8 cash and deposited into their account.

**Side note:**

Should probably add that in some cases even though the company is bought it still continues under its own name and management rather than being engulfed. In that case your shares go up in value and you get to keep them rather then being converted into cash.",AuthorAdamOConnell,1612777607.0,16

If Netflix (or whoever) decides to do an all-cash deal, a price per share will be agreed upon, and if the acquisition is approved, shareholders in the company being acquired (in this case, AMC) will receive that exact amount in cash per share in their brokerage account, once the dust settles.

If Netflix (or whomever) decides to do an all-stock deal, an amount that one share in the company being acquired's stock will get you in the company acquiring's stock will be determined by the 2 parties.

SQ probably has further to fall, although I do think it's reaching a bottom and could rally on a bit of positive news. It's a stock I held for a long time, but I've recently sold because they seem to be more interested in taking large bets on things like Bitcoin and the blockchain these days rather than building a sustainable business.

10605,hzsxkxg,t3_t8s2nt,"Not financial advise but some thoughts on Facebook. 1st, it really is the one stock almost everyone loves to hate and it has been this way for years.  The stock’s reaction to last quarter’s disappointing earnings shows how much it is hated because it had been slaughtered. My own opinion is people should wait a little longer because while there is always more downside to the stock,  the price is so cheap now that the odds will be to the upside once this market finds it’s footing. FB is projected to grow to $134M in sales this year from $117M last year (15%). It trades at a PE of 15 but if you strip out the cash on it’s balance sheet and stopped the $10B a year being spent on the Metaverse, it would have a PE of 10-11.   It would trade at half the PE of the S&P with double the average growth rate of 7% on the S&P.  So someone has this wrong. Either FB is super cheap and will recover or their business is in real trouble and this will show up in their next earnings release in late April.

Despite the social media side of the business looking like it's peaked in terms of user growth, they are producing a massive amount of cash (almost $40B in earnings for 2021) and haven't started monetising the 'reels' feature on Facebook (the feature that aims to compete with TikTok). Even so, I don't think I will be adding it to my portfolio at the moment just down to the fact that I don't use facebook and am not a big fan of that type of social media.

SQ could definitely keep going down near term cuz of its valuation but if it does I’ll be averaging down the whole way.

And imo part of Apples success is also the lock in effect and synergies they have through said ecosystem. But i really don't see the average Netflix subscriber convert to Apple hardware just because they bought it.

* Content. Existing IP with the potential to expand on it as well as building a base to keep people hooked is what Apple lacks. But so does Netflix, at least relatively speaking compared to many other streaming services. Since everybody is doing their own streaming service now and pulling their content, Netflix has to spend a lot on creating new shows and movies. Also where as Apple seems to go for quality over quantity (in line with their brand), Netflix pretty much does the opposite. Sub par content imo could even hurt Apple more than help.

* Netflix even after the drop is a large company. I don't think Apple really does those kind of take overs, they usually just do their own thing or if anything go for smaller companies.

So basically Netflix imo is the opposite of what Apple wants. I am not sure if they even want to buy something right now or are fine with the slow and steady growth. But if they do, then they'd want something like Amazon buying MGM. Smallish and with memorable IP like James Bond.",golli123,1650565430.0,1

10652,i6ipvof,t3_udmh5o,"Echoing the sentiment of other commenters, but adding some numbers for context: no, MSFT shouldn’t attempt to purchase NFLX — even if you ignore the fact that they’re already in the process of trying to close another mega deal. 

NFLX is profitable, but net income doesn’t really matter in film, cash flow does. Despite clearing $5 billion in NI, the company’s operations only generated $392 million of cash flow. Compare that to its outstanding debt balance of $14.5 billion and you see why a company would hesitate to bring such a company into their own books. 

The film & TV industry isn’t profitable for most participants, largely because it’s such a hit-or-miss business. I used to work in the finance side of this industry — it’s mostly a billionaires playground. Streaming platforms insulate themselves a little bit through subscription revenue, but there are so many options now that they’re still pressured to **continually** pump out high quality movies and shows — hence why NFLX used $17.7 billion of cash on content last year, which they will likely continue doing for the foreseeable future or else risk losing unsatisfied subscribers.

They are shedding all assets not helping streaming. They are selling their publishing company, currently blocked by DOJ.

Sold some Hollywood studio to a real estate company.

Long term debt is not due for awhile. So no worries.

The whole streaming business model is centered around having the most content to stream for every individual’s taste. Netflix is already light years ahead in this realm and continues to get further ahead because of how much they invest into content.

In fact, I’d argue the fact that there are still competitors is bullish for Netflix. None of these competitors have any chance of catching up to Netflix and will all die because they aren’t able/willing to invest in having enough content to appeal to enough people for a long enough time. When they die, Netflix just absorbs all of their content and viewers.

I think Netflix will have slow growth for the next 1-2 years while people are eager to go out then realize streaming at home is much more convenient.

Amazon Prime and Hulu and other services like Crunchy Roll for anime fans for example are just destroying the appeal of having to pay for Netflix. Their user interface and the complete garbage navigation of the available content is atrocious. Almost as bad as YouTube's smart tv app's search function.

10967,gv9akt6,t3_muz471,"It was going to happen eventually with HBO, Disney+, and other competitors coming in. Netflix also hasn't had many releases people were hyped for as production stagnated, and that's why they've been trying to tap into new areas such as anime, which has seen their popularity soar in the latter half of 2020 and this year in expense of traditional TV shows. Netflix is especially vulnerable since their streaming service is most of their revenue. For a stock that had a good run right when the pandemic hit, there was bound to be pullback. 

It's also a bearish sign for tech stocks in general, and we've already started to see a rotation to value. This might be a flashing signal that the tech boom in 2020 is starting to end. I'm still going to hold my AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL as I think they can weather it out, but if NASDAQ continues to fall this week, we might see the loss of multiple support points. The biggest losers though, will probably be speculative tech stocks, and despite the April green days, ARKK, and a lot of SPACs have barely moved.

11417,i8aw6os,t3_unlngs,"This might be cathartic so I'll give it a go.

Preface it by saying I was more of the Burry/Bearish constitution months ago, so had largely avoided big tech. Prefer going down the ""value"" route, so was looking for undervalued plays.

1. Foot Locker. Probably my most contrarian position. Was in around the 40s and deemed it still undervalued. Have averaged down since but am definitely well down on initial investment. Decently run company that have been there, done that. Know how to survive recession which is a major plus in the current environment. Little debt, the reported figures on their balance sheets are related to rentals and lease obligations rather than actual debt. Where my major contrarian point comes in: Last earnings they acknowledged Nike's increasing move to DTC and that the share of Nike products they would sell would decrease (target is no one brand consists of more than 50% of their sales). They had already begun that transition away from Nike, pivoting towards other brands to make up the loss and beat revenue as well as beating EPS estimates. Furthermore, they'd recently acquired two new retailers, WSS and Atmos (an Asian chain to begin expansion into Asian markets). They acknowledged coming headwinds, with further reducing their reliance on Nike, the inflationary environment and supply chain issues. Stock plummeted after earnings. I think what was missed here is they've already started a successful transition from Nike and while their forward, short term estimates look like contraction, it's contraction from their already estimate beating revenues. They'll keep making money, very little debt to service and in the last week have just announced a strategic partnership with Adidas. Also worth noting they hiked their dividend and are going on a share buyback spree (not that I discount these things, just when I'm looking at a business my two most immediately important criteria is are they making money and what are their liabilities). Overall I think the market has this one wrong but am willing to accept the risk, especially a discretionary retailer in a recession/cost of living crisis environment. Plan: Holding - Might reinvest dividends.
2. Sibanye Stillwater. Boy these guys have had a rocky couple of months. From rocketing high on possible sanctions of Russian platinum and palladium to tanking on a combination of said sanctions not coming to pass (well, not to the level expected as of yet), decreasing prices of metals and a gold miner strike in South Africa. Again, I like this crew overall. Much like Foot Locker, I think the executives have some sense about them and see the wood for the trees. They're pivoting more and more into battery metals and ""green"" metals as well as exploring uranium mining while continuing their platinum group metal projects. Gold is a dying sector for them and I don't believe they'll look to acquire any further interest in same. Serviceable debt, consistent profits, all in sustaining costs for their PGM operations in both US and SA are well below the price these metals are fetching and have a lot of room to fall before they're not making money on them. Gold a different story. It's almost a goodwill project from them to continue employing people in SA because the actual income stream from it just isn't there. Which is where the miner strike gets tricky, because they want a wage increase of 1000 Rand a month and Sibanye have offered 850, which has been refused, as well as other options such as profit sharing that has also been refused. Not sure how much longer the gold mining side of things will be viable. They've also some Nickel mining operations in Europe and have a 50% stake in Ioneer's Lithium-Boron project in Nevada which could be very profitable. Overall, much of what they mine is in high demand, their executive team look like the understand the need to pivot more and more towards mining metals ""of the future"", with that they'll largely expand into other global territories reducing their reliance on SA and the geopolitical risks involved, not to mention they pay a big dividend. Goldman Sachs have just initiated a buy on them as well. Plan: Holding - Might reinvest dividends/add to position the further we fall.
3. Kinross Gold. Another miner and I think one I'm less convinced of. They're Gold only and their all in sustaining costs for gold mining is good, enough that gold has a lot of room to fall before they stop making money on it, but I'm just not sure on them. A couple of good mines and recently acquired the Great Bear project in Canada which is supposedly very high quality, their revenues etc are okay, flat, and a slight bump in net profit this quarter but estimated EPS miss. Pay a small dividend which I'm not super fussed over. Don't like that they've taken on further debt recently. Will see, in fairness to them I probably am being unfair in that I'm getting uneasy having not had any production out of Great Bear yet. Plan: Holding - Don't think I'll add more as I honestly would prefer to go into Sibanye (and probably should've focused on same from the get go)
4. GameStop. Flies in the face of my bearishness but it's been a hell of a lot of fun. Not going into a whole chat about a turnaround plan or NFT marketplace or any of that craic, because it's all speculative. Plan: Holding - Too much fun to sell out.

They're my lot. Feel better having typed it out. Downturns suck, especially to this magnitude, but I suppose I had based my investing on companies that weren't in the middle of a frothy bubble and hitting ATHs every day, so it was always with a very long term view. (Nothing wrong with the tech companies that were consumed in the bubble, the likes of Google or Microsoft are money printing giants, it's just I reckoned I'd get a much better entry point at a later stage).",Somaliona,1652352612.0,2

Google's revenue growth is one example. It went to like 40% or so from roughly 12 to 15% the years before. And many valuations seem like people used that 40% growth - or used 30%  and thought  they were being conservative - for their estimates.

The prospect of doubling your money may sound daunting. Given enough years, you have an *outstandingly* good chance to do just that. The trick is to adjust your idea of how long that takes.

The stock market slowly rises over the long term - something like 8% per year if you reinvest your dividends. So here's a little math exercise. Take 1.08 and multiply it by 1.08. That represents two years of gains. Keep multiplying by 1.08 and you see that it doubles in 9 years. In 18 years it doubles twice. 27 years, three times, 36 years four times etc.

Here's the thing though : three doubles is not 2+2+2; it's 2x2x2. So three doubles multiplies your money by 8. Four doubles multiplies your money by 16. If you are young enough that you can invest for 45 years, you will multiply your money by 32 times!

You don't have to hit home runs to make a lot of money in the stock market. You can make an absolute killing in the market just hitting singles if you give it enough time.

So what does it mean to ""hit singles""? Don't pressure yourself to keep up with the latest hot company. Have a broad basket of stocks where a few of them are cool and sexy, but most are boring but profitable. Examples could be retailers, banks and insurers, manufacturers, home builders, truck/train, utilities, real estate (REITs), and many more.

If you like the idea of investing but you want to let someone else pick the stocks, get an S&P index etf like SPY.

You can do this! Don't give up!

Why did you buy so much stuff? I own 4 different stocks because they’re the only ones that after hours of research and analysis I’ve decided are worth my time and risk. I read the financial statements, listen to their earnings calls and because of that can stay a few steps ahead of things and/or know when not to panic.

It’s easy to give up if you’re just randomly buying stocks you don’t understand and then are surprised when they go down. It’s much harder to give up when you have an unshakable belief in the future of the companies you’re invested in because you know that patience will pay off. If you haven’t done that research then you’re sitting there with your thumb up your ass with no idea what to do next. 

Basically, you haven’t totally fucked up here. You learned a valuable lesson and now you need to be patient. Even those people who invested at the peak of the market before the global financial crisis saw their investments recover. If they did nothing and didn’t panic sell they’d still make money, perhaps just over a longer time horizon than they planned. That’s where you are. Don’t fucking sell. If you invested the money you didn’t need it for anything important. That shouldn’t have changed. You haven’t lost anything unless you chicken out.",Sad_Researcher_5299,1646489802.0,22

I'm not saying don't buy meme stocks, just realize what you are getting yourself into. If you want to gamble with your money, by all means go ahead. Putting money in a stock because a meme told you to, going to Vegas or betting on a horse race ... I don't know the statistics but they all feel about the same to me. 

If you want to invest on the other hand, put in the work. Learn what EPS over TTM means. Look into dollar cost averaging. Discover macro economic trends that are still on the horizon. Watch and see how geopolitical events can throw a wrench into everything, but that may actually be a good thing for some equities. And don't forget that investing incorporates more than just the stock market. Depending on inflation and other factors, look at bonds or real estate.

This will take an enormous amount of effort and time. But if you only want a quick buck, I recommend Vegas. At least then you'll enjoy watching your money get flushed down the toilet.

You bought really heavy on tech. So did I. My losses look like yours. Going forward, I'd recommend re-evaluating *why* you choose a stock. Pick something because you feel it will either work for you in the long run, or because you feel it's undervalued. My best undervalued pick was F at 12, and I ditched it at 15. 25% is huge, but I only put 10% of a small capital into buying undervalued. My biggest long term has been AAPL at $112, and I put 90% of my investment capital into long term investments.

Take it slow. If you make this a race, you'll lose. Don't take your stock advice from Reddit because we're all amateurs and you have no way of knowing if we're telling the truth. If you can't pick a company, pick a concept and buy an ETF. Sometimes those do poorly too *cough*TAN*cough* but the drops are a lot slower.

If you pick individual stocks, their returns are always going to be widely different from each other. The important thing with individual stocks is to understand when they are over-valued (selling opportunity) and when they are undervalued (buying opportunities). 

For example, in 2020, I went 40% energy, 40% FANGs, and 20% semiconductors. As FANGs and Semis reached their high point in 2021 I began selling FANGs and Semiconductors and moving into Financials and Energy. Now as Energy is picking up, I’m slowly (de-risking) my energy position in favor of Financials, Fintel, SaaS, and Semiconductors. \]

Don’t miss the forest for the trees. If you focus to closely on a singular stock and their relative returns to one another and to the broader market you will miss what is going on with the broader sector and the market as a whole. 

That’s why most people invest in the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ or the DJI. Indexing allows you to focus on the overall market instead of having to pick individual stocks. 

I prefer to pick sectors for 80% of my positions. 20% of the my positions are individiual selections that are made up of LEAPs and long positions.

11818,hzgsstt,t3_t7996j,"It's a good lesson to learn now. During the bubble phase of an asset, whether its stocks/houses/crypto, valuations keeps going up. It's basically a game of musical chair to see who is left standing when the music stops.

It's hard mentally to not FOMO when it continues for 2+ years to not buy in, since there's nothing else to invest in because interest rates are at zero, and cash is basically being eaten away by inflation.

There is something I can say though, is that I would have never touch certain stocks when their P/E is sky high or market cap is large but continues to make losses every year, and be wary of companies that issue so much stock-based compensation that the GAAP and non-GAAP valuations are so far apart.

You entered at the wrong time. Accept the loss and move on. You don't have to sell on the ones you think will do alright, but don't expect a quick recovery. The best way to move forward is to continue to invest. How you want to do that is up to you -- you can wait until the rate hikes are ongoing, or just invest every time you get paid, and you can pick individual stocks if you think the companies are good or simply buy index funds to avoid picking stocks.

Individual stocks are more volatile and you should focus on the ones you are familiar with. In your list, the companies you invest in spans media, home improvement, consumer finance, online gambling, internet technology, healthcare and so forth. I can barely understand one segment of technology which is semiconductors that I focused on, specifically AMD, Intel and Nvidia.

I doubt that you can actually understand all those industry that you're invested in. Thinking you understand just because you've read news releases and you've read the companies' financials is dicey at best. You also have to look into competitors and the general marketplace etc, as well as leadership, but even then it is still only an approximate at best because you are many miles removed from the companies.

Edit: Also valuations are important. When PE is sky high, a lot of the future earnings expected is already account for. So when a hyped company merely meets expectations of great growth, instead of accelerating even more, their stock price falls by 10+%, as has recently happened with a lot of the high flying stocks.

My recommendation is to stay involved. Continue to follow the companies you've already invested in and see how they develop. Continue to invest. Invest in index funds for now if you are a bit wary of picking individual stocks. Then later, a smaller portion of the money can be used to invest in individual stocks that you feel strongly about.",huangr93,1646497618.0,1

Most of the stocks you’ve mentioned are actually decent companies BUT, (correct me if I’m wrong) it looks like you didn’t pay any attention to THE PRICE YOU PAID for them. This is one of the most common mistakes people make when they first get into investing; investors look at the companies business model, revenue growth record/projections, industry growth potential and other important factors but they don’t stop to consider if the stock might be overvalued. As we’ve been in a crazy bull market for a long while, we’ve not had to pay as much attention to how much we are paying for earnings, however, any famous investor makes it very clear that the price you pay for a business is a huge factor in how successful you are as an investor! 
Overall though - don’t worry too much and just use this as a learning experience. You are already doing a lot better than most new investors who like to chuck money into only super speculative or penny stocks.

From there, use the experience to decide where, or if you went wrong. It sounds like you bought a lot of stocks that were way overvalued and were chasing returns. Maybe you could read up on how to value a company and see how that helps you.

Also, learn about researching and evaluating companies futures. The stock market is forward looking, so keep that in mind. High oil prices? Bad time to own an airline. Etc. Research 50 companies before investing in anything. Then apply that knowledge to your current holdings. Would you buy them at their current prices? If not, it's ok to cut them at a loss and find a better investment. Don't be married to a stock for no reason. 

Finally, learn patience. There are market opportunities, but it's hard to allocate all your capital at once. Learn patience. There will always be another opportunity.

Your stocks are aggressive, many fast growth, high PE stocks that tend to fluctuate massively from high to low, especially in situations like this with raising rates and war. 

I have no issue with your specific picks but your mentality behind it is going to get you crushed in the market. 

1. Don’t watch the market daily
2. Dollar cost average. 
3. If you can’t handle the big drops start to pick up index funds and use a less aggressive investment style.

If you believe in these stocks and and fundamentals have not change dramatically (just market sentiment or temporary setbacks) then now is the time to be buying more.  

At the very least try some nice index funds, most of which are also down a bit and might pose a good buying opportunities.

You are utilizing a highly aggressive, long term stock picking style with a short term mentality. This is a receipt for huge losses. These stocks were guaranteed to have big drops eventually. This is what long term means. You don’t panic and deal with this emotionally and continuous invest. 

If you didn’t want the risk of big swings, some safe, diversified index funds, dividend funds and REITs would have been the way to go. 

It’s your decision, how to learn from this and understand your the risk profile you can handle emotionally.  

I personally wound not sell out and quit. This is a way to guarantee you lose long term. But you do need to shift your thinking a lot to have success.

I had early success with crypto but see it mostly as a scam now.  It's kind of a lottery ticket when they're new, but then once they get big, they just follow the market but are less stable.  Or, they largely die off into obscurity unless there's significant and long lasting marketing work to bring them to mainstream which I think takes a LOT of money by early adopters banking on it exploding.

Indexes are solid investments.  They're managed and return well.  Leveraged is better in most cases short times of recession.

Oil can make you a lot of money, but it's a cycle.  You can time the periods and do well.  There's leveraged ETFs that can do really well when timed right.

Pharm stocks can be fun.  These tend to explode on success of clinical trials, FDA approval, and such, and a bunch of this is on known time tables.  The risk is when they fail.  The stock can drop 80% overnight.  But it can also double overnight if successful.

You can use websites like Tradingview to watch stocks and use trend tools to evaluate changes.  Personally, I've found volume weighted moving averages and direction indicator graphs to tell a lot about how stocks are changing.  These tend to show obvious precursors of change that you can follow.

Big stock changes are often news based.  A CEO buying or selling stock, a merger or sell off, earnings reports, and similar events cause spikes and dips.  These are hard to benefit from because most of the change already happened by market open.

Get friendly with Excel.  You can expand on data analytics, watch trends, look at statistics, and compare stocks against the market.  For example, i like to weight stocks against an index that's representative of the market.  The whole market pulses up and down, so it's rough to watch just one stock and know if it was ok or natural for it to go down.  If the index went down but the stock went down less, it's actually doing better than the broad market.  You can also look at statistics like standard deviations.  Is the stock change natural?  Or is the jump or drop far outside of the norm? Then it's important to check why.

Stocks almost always follow the greater average.  The big picture trends tend to remain, despite 1 to 3 month spikes or dips.  The market always seems to correct eventually.  You might have to wait 3 to 6 months for that to happen, but stocks do return to their norms.

Don't chase peaks.  Buy on dips.  There are cyclical stocks you can ride.  And there's often nothing safer than a good index ETF, and a leveraged index is often one of the better plays overall (except during a recession).  Also, be willing to pull money out of the market and wait for good timing.  This last one is the one I'm still learning and not doing it tends to be the thing that erodes away my gains.  You don't always have to be in something.

For the year of playing, with the big recession drops, i ended up around break even.  There were plays that I was hesitant on and things i knew i should have done but didn't.  If I acted wholly on my planning, i would have been around 4x for gains, even after the big dips.  But I made a bunch of dumb moves.  I'm learning.",mvw2,1646503658.0,1

The QE experiment has never been run before in history… it’s now being turned off. De-globalization is underfoot. The emphasis of the global economy is shifting from efficiency to resilience. 

I have a hard time believing that the businesses best set up to benefit from the prior paradigm will also be optimal for the next phase. In real terms, apple is highly leveraged to China. Both in terms of supply chain and product sales. Google is leveraging to economic growth and marketing spend (a recession means decreasing GDP, means layoffs, marketing spend typically drops first for companies). Amazon is facing unions, and slower economic growth. Start-ups are laying people off and unable to raise capital (VCs are sending out notes across the board saying no capital from us for the next 12 months minimum), and most of their best cloud customers are start-ups that got big. FB seems totally screwed. Netflix is being beaten by companies with an existing cash cow, that allows them to subsidize their content production. 

Long story short, the world is changing. It is de-globalizing and de-leveraging. PE multiple will come down as interest rates rise. This hurts hurt the tech sector more than anything else.

12057,i5u5jay,t3_u9tddr,"I posted this in r/Investing yesterday and I think it’s relevant here, too:

I’ve bought [22,000](https://imgur.com/a/RVNolb0) shares of Meta in the past 8 weeks. They are criminally undervalued and I’m happy to take scared money. It’s FCF machine, growing at double digits, sitting on a $60B war chest. 

You need to do your own due diligence, and when one makes a seven figure trade, the due diligence is pages long. But I'll add just a few notes beyond Big Blue’s ad biz:

It’s got one of the cleanest, if not the strongest, balance sheets in all of America. I’m on mobile so I’d have to go back later and check my notes, but I had the intrinsic value of $FB roughly at >$410. 

If a “bad” quarter, regularly scheduled poor guidance from a sandbagger of a CFO, a war between two countries that have the GDP of Italy and the threat of a measly 25 bps rate rise want to scare the market into selling me the stock at a 50% discount, I will *literally* buy millions of it. Gladly.

They haven't even monetized WhatsApp, which has 2B+ reach in the world. I'm not sure Americans understand how reliant places like India and Brazil are on WhatsApp. You literally order food, get a cab and speak with your doctor via WhatsApp. It's essentially a public utility for most of the world. And it continues to grow. Yet the money faucet hasn't been turned on. There is likely tens of billions yet to be tapped into here.

Threats of TikTok were overstated (intentionally), Reels isn't yet monetized (Instagram continues to grow), growth of Blue (Facebook's core product) were in line (it's gotta saturate at some point). Yes, iOS 14 privacy changes hurt, but there are ways of aggregating data on the backend using personal identifiers as a way of building your ad profile. This will take time, but they will continue to grow, despite what legendary sandbagger CFO Wehner says. And keep in mind, Meta doesn't sell your data, they sell targeting. People love to misquote this. And the talent they have at the company, my god, is the best in the Valley.

Lastly, I don't care if you love him or hate him, Zuck will go down as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time: buying Instagram for $1B and which is now worth well over $100B, buying WhatsApp for a paltry $19B which essentially owns messaging worldwide and is the world's communication utility (except for the US, which they are trying to break into (did you see the ads during the AFC Championship game)) and now the Metaverse. Google and Microsoft are bleeding top talent to Meta to build the Metaverse which will be CapEx heavy for years. Meta is lightyears ahead in this space. And don't get it twisted - while you may not use the Metaverse, Gen Z will (in ways, they already are) and they will spend money in it. It is the future whether you like it or not.

(Also, good fucking luck, Lina Khan)

I could go on forever about Meta....

Can it go lower? Yes, it absolutely can. I'm betting it will. Can I be wrong, and you right? Absolutely. We'll see.

Why do I think this?

&#x200B;

Because of the macro shift. If the Fed follows through then I personally think the top is in for the market for the next bit, and it's going to be nothing but sideways and downward with maybe some pops that get sold off. Rinse repeat as they either walk the market down or it dips into a recession.

&#x200B;

They literally printed money and bought assets, and they're going to sell their holdings AND raise rates. They aren't kicking the can anymore and they keep telling you guys this to your face repeatedly.

&#x200B;

People keep saying the market is oversold, and sure it is relative to where it was during the free money pandemic pump, but it isnt IF its going to go even lower than people expect. And the Fed JUST started turning hawkish. It's like people have no attention span and think a leg down means we're done.

Sure, itll go up and down. That's what it does. But the TOP DOWN trend is down until they change their tune.

&#x200B;

I don't know when you got into trading/investing but if it was during the pandemic you should understand that the ""free money"" ""buy the dip"" policy is gone.

FB may be a great company with a good balance sheet and debt, but that doesn't matter if the Fed is literally going to start sucking money out of the market.

A lot of people are worried about the trade off between theaters and streaming -- I feel like it's actually the tv networks are at the expense of streaming SVOD and AVOD platforms. The reason being is mostly product -- when these streaming services announce their product, they might mention a few films but *it is always the tv series* that are the core to the platform. They are the Crown Jewels that keep people subscribed. Some examples:

&#x200B;

Disney: Wandavision, Mandalorian

Paramount+: Star Trek franchise, Frazier, Rugrats, Avatar: The Last Airbender franchise

Netflix: Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Queen's Gambit, The Crown

HBO Max: Sex and the City, The Flight Attendant

Peacock: The Office, Law & Order SVU Franchise

Hulu: Handmaiden's Tale, Dollface, Solar Opposites

Since they said that, they absolutely have become HBO (look at all their originals), before HBO could become them.  Instead of HBO though, you have CBS and Disney.

This is all to say, the battle comes down to original content.  Can they create enough original content people demand better than other people can.  The scary part here is that the original content is a hard fight to win.  You need to build up tent pole series (Think GoT for HBO, Orange and House of Cards for Netflix, Star Trek for CBS, and all disney for Disney).  In this world, CBS and Disney have an advantage in IP.  HBO has historical ability to do it.  

TLDR.  Netflix next has to compete one things which it doesn't have advantage (content) from the position of 1st.  My personal judgement says its scary and not worth the multiples today.

12389,hu1gx6z,t3_sbh68l,"Relatively new to investing, about 7 years in. Rode through multiple dips, profited and beating S&P by a healthy margin. Here’s what I do:

1. Make sure your thesis on a stock’s recovery is rock solid. It could dip more — if it does, you don’t want to feel mad or fearful, you want to be GREEDY. Remember that thing you researched on Amazon for days? Then it went on sale and you scooped it up ASAP? That’s the feeling……. I’m not so confident on your picks, but you do you. I’m more of a value investor, less of Cathie Woods.

2. As others said, DCA and dabble in the stock a bit. NO MARKET ORDERS — set your limit order at two stages: one as a “I can live with it” price on the day, and two as a “reach goal” as Good until Cancelled. You’ll be surprised when market overreacts and you just got a deal. 

3. Mental preparation. I keep DCA’ing, automatically through limit orders. Spend as little time as you can on the app, you want to be immune to the red. Invest, turn off app, and train yourself to get hard when you see your favorite stock “on sale”

Tldr: gradually DCA into rock solid companies on sale and turn off app.

Good luck!",monark824,1643044162.0,1

Imo the momentum in the selling of growth tech isn't sustainable and is completely unjustified at this point. I don't like the ARKK fund, but the majority of Cathie's holdings simply don't deserve to be as down as much as they when you look at valuations. It's even more crazy when you look at where some of these names are trading relative to the broader market.

On Monday I'm selling everything and rotating fully into growth tech. It may be a mistake, but it's just so insane to me that stocks like NFLX are now trading at pre-pandemic levels that I feel I have to take this bet. I get growth is slowing, I get that multiples probably need to come in a bit, but the price of a stock like NFLX is just ridiculous given the multiples NFLX has historically traded at and the growth it's seen since it was trading at $400 in 2018.

Just looking at what was sold today and what has been sold this past month I'm becoming more and more convinced the big boys are just trying to shake retail out of the market. I don't buy the argument that you need to rotate into trash for safety. No one in their right mind should want to sell a stock like SHOP or NFLX for crap like IBM and CSCO, especially not when SHOP is trading at a PE of 32 and NFLX at a PE of 35!!

If Spotify has a lot of success with podcasts and other form of fixed cost acquisition content, they have a good shot.

The problem is that the bigger the music catalog the studio is get, especially with their back catalog, the more leverage they have over Spotify. In the case of Spotify their costs don't go down the more that they grow. The reason is that they owe a per stream licensing fee to a studio.

Netflix on the other hand produces a significant amount of original content which is a fixed cost investment.  Netflix becomes significantly more profitable the more they scale.",2k2k2020,1593096045.0,21

12452,fvyoou6,t3_hfmyjr,"Honestly, much as the market loves Spotify scoring all these exclusive deals with big name people, I think the deals will be seen as a big mistake in the long term.

The public doesn't like it when you yank content from one place they normally get it from and lock it in one place that you have to get it from. History shows most people are **not** willing to follow streamers/etc. to the new location.

Shroud for example lost 85% of his viewers when took a bunch of money from Microsoft to stream exclusively on their (now defunct) streaming service. The fact that the service is now defunct says it all in regards to how well Microsoft spent those tens of millions of dollars locking in exclusivity deals. Viewers didn't even have to pay to watch Shroud, it was literally just typing in a different URL in their web browser.

So I remain deeply skeptical that Spotify can become anything close to Netflix. The Music industry makes sure that music streaming has very little if any profit for most streaming companies, so Spotify would have to depend on other areas to become a 'Netflix'.",ShadowLiberal,1593099319.0,1

Whether they overtake in subscribers and how soon all depends on when growth slows to the pace of Netflix. So far it looks like the first two quarters will have gains of 25m+.With a good deal of key markets left to open in (Western Europe, Latin America, Asia), I genuinely think we may see both q3 and q4 have 20m+ net gains. That would be a huge plus for overtaking Netflix. 

The key questions are 

At what point does it stop having 20m+ gains

At what point does it stop having 15m+ gains

At what point does it stop having 10m+ gains

If we can get through 2021 without breaking through all of these then I would consider it forgone.

With that said, I cannot stand SQ.  From my viewpoint, it is one of the worst stocks I have reviewed, and I've parsed several hundred, maybe a thousand by this point.  It's performance over the last month, quarter, half year, year, etc. are downright bad, it's 50% off of its 52W high, has excessive debt, and ridiculous valuation multiples.

The *only* thing that it has going for it is a decent track record of sales growth, and a decent projected EPS growth over the next 5 years.  If you're a long-term investor, I ask this - can anyone really predict where we're going to be as a planet in the next 5 years?  COVID came out of left field and smacked us in the face, and that was only around 2 years ago since everything kicked off.

If that's the metric you're leaning on, maybe you'll be right, or maybe a year or two from now SQ will be a hole in the ground due to the crash it takes when interest rate hikes slow down growth, and make its existing debt levels untenable.  Coupled with a continuing downwards trend in their performance, they're going to be able to leverage equity less effectively without issuing more shares, devaluing existing shares in the process and accelerating the stock price decline.  It's either that, or take on more debt to fuel growth, which will be less efficient an approach than it is now.

I pointed this out yesterday at /r/valueinvesting.

Currently trades at $27.00. So generating value to shareholders and customers is going to be his top priority for greed's sake.

I'm still interested to see if Amazon produce a better platform for prime video.  If they do it'd add another viable competitor.
